I will continue working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep these harmful products out of our children‚Äôs hands. https://t.co/LNeWR4eDKOTomorrow night (August 21), I'll be holding a town hall in @DraperCity at the Draper City Library (1136 Pioneer Rd.) at 7:00 PM. Looking forward to hearing from local residents. #utpolUtah‚Äôs biotech companies are making great strides toward innovation within the pharmaceutical industry. Participated in a BioUtah Roundtable with more than 20 of these companies today after touring Biomerics in Salt Lake City. https://t.co/eLszITl3r8Great to sit down with my friend @BoydMatheson for @KSLnewsradio today discussing conservatism, ways to tackle the debt &amp; deficit, and other news of the day. Thanks for having me on, Boyd! https://t.co/vL773BYNZjRight now, neither party is focused on the debt and deficit. We spent nearly $300 billion last year on the interest of our debt alone! Tackling our debt must be made a priority. Listen to more of my conversation with @BoydMatheson on @KSLnewsradio‚Üí https://t.co/vvMEZdpNR9On Tuesday (Aug. 20), I‚Äôll be hosting a town hall in the Uintah Basin to hear from local residents. Join me at the Uintah Conference Center in Vernal (313 E. 200 S) at 6:30 PM. #utpolGreat news for the Beehive State ‚Üí https://t.co/dkMy5CCpLJThe worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cEThe nation has witnessed senseless loss of life from recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, and Gilroy. My statement: https://t.co/3XhcfV3fmKAnother heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.As the current longest-serving member of Utah's delegation, Rob Bishop has dedicated his life to public service. As chairman of @NatResources, Rob has been a vital voice for Utah public lands, leading passage of the largest public lands conservation bill in more than a decade.Ann and I offer our heartfelt condolences to the family of Norma Matheson. As the First Lady of Utah, she led causes that improved the lives of many in our state. Our prayers are with her family, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.Kept the #PioneerDay celebrations going with my fellow Utahns at last night‚Äôs Flavors of Utah event, hosted by @SenMikeLee. What a great opportunity to show folks in Washington what our state is about and, prove that we really do have the best food in the country! #utpol https://t.co/HkXN8ZRQmEWithin this funding from @HHSGov is a $520,000 grant to @AUCHUtah that will help 12 health centers across the state improve the use of information technology. This is good news for Utah, especially our state's rural communities. https://t.co/6nl9plTvHTOn Pioneer Day, I think specifically of my pioneer ancestors. My great-great grandfather, Miles Romney, designed the famous spiral staircases in the St. George Tabernacle and my 4x-great grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, advanced Brigham Young‚Äôs route to the Salt Lake Valley. https://t.co/3ImQVp6Z4tToday, we celebrate and honor the legacy of faith, hard work, and innovation of the courageous pioneers who, fearing no toil nor labor, journeyed west into the Salt Lake Valley. Wishing all Utahns a wonderful Pioneer Day! #alliswell https://t.co/qiIwZ3bN1VPleased to see Stephen Dickson confirmed as FAA Administrator. I look forward to working with him on issues that impact Utah, like proposed expansions of smaller community airports like Moab, and larger concerns I have regarding air safety, specifically the Boeing 737 Max. https://t.co/jrVibs6zMeThis is a good step to protect young people across the country from the dangers of e-cigarettes. As a society, we have a collective responsibility to keep these harmful products out of our children's hands and protect them from a lifetime of addiction. https://t.co/OsnPT7u5EcAccess to public lands is a major concern among Utah‚Äôs rural counties. Met with Uintah County commissioners to discuss their plan to maintain and ensure motorized access to the public lands within their county and offer assistance in proving the status of the County‚Äôs roads. https://t.co/MdNdvS0OPH#USMCA would be of great benefit to Utah‚Äôs agricultural industry. Welcomed my friend Ron Gibson, Utah @FarmBureau President, to the office to discuss USMCA, the important role agriculture plays in food safety, and the current challenges facing the industry. https://t.co/Qlauxkbngi.@UStreasury‚Äôs decision to expand preventative care benefits provided by high deductible health plans and HSAs will help those with chronic conditions afford the medical care they need.
https://t.co/hom3ha82dbThe DoD's 180-day hiring restriction prevents military installations, like Utah‚Äôs @HAFB, from hiring the most qualified candidates for civilian jobs. Our bill removes unnecessary barriers so the DoD can hire retired servicemembers in a more timely manner. https://t.co/Zfq2du600oMy favorite meat is hot dog üå≠ Happy #NationalHotDogDay! https://t.co/xrForVbLOFA lesson in reading the fine print! The future is bright for this young Utah entrepreneur. https://t.co/bJgyaIFhQeDiscussing our bills to prevent Huawei from threatening America‚Äôs national security and other news of the day with @D2KSL on @KSLnewsradio at 12:05 p.m. Listen live: https://t.co/GQ5oxLI1QkHad the honor of introducing Utahn David Barlow at his @SenateJudiciary hearing this morning. I have full confidence David will faithfully apply the law and our Constitution to all matters and parties that come before him and urge my colleagues to support his swift confirmation. https://t.co/sRP1GQJxutLive soon‚Üí I'll be introducing South Jordan‚Äôs David Barlow in front of @SenateJudiciary to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit. Tune in: https://t.co/4zz3JnXBAqWhen @ChrisMurphyCT and I met with Iraqi leaders, they underscored not wanting to become a vassal state of Iran. The Iraqi government needs a strategy to address its relationship with Iran‚Äîwhich includes creating closer ties with other countries in the region. https://t.co/oM9fNBzsgtWhile ISIS no longer has a territorial caliphate, Iraq still faces major security challenges. The government must figure out how to sustain a vibrant economy, whether and how to assimilate returning ISIS fighters, and how to counter excessive Iranian influence. https://t.co/Eg8iHxgnvNIraq is a place of enormous strategic interest for the U.S. In light of ongoing challenges, the key question now for us is how to best support Iraq‚Äôs efforts to achieve a secure and prosperous future and become a stabilizing force in the region. https://t.co/dFtQeYV6JmIraq has proven for nearly two decades to be the place where vital U.S. interests in the Middle East intersect. Live soon‚Üí I‚Äôll be chairing the @SenateForeign Near East subcommittee hearing with Ranking Member @ChrisMurphyCT on this very topic. Tune in: https://t.co/Q9IZFchd15We must make a concerted effort to confront the threat China poses to U.S. national security, intellectual property &amp; technology. Pleased the House adopted the Huawei amendment I wrote with @RepGallagher and will work with my colleagues to ensure its inclusion in the final #NDAA.@JDRFAdvocacy @JDRF I will continue working with my @GOPhelp colleagues on finding ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs and reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for American consumers.It's outrageous that the cost of insulin has tripled over the past 15 years. For the millions of Americans living with diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life and death. Appreciated learning from and hearing the stories of these young Utahns living with Type 1 diabetes. https://t.co/aRFoGPPxsu#USMCA is a marked improvement on NAFTA and ratification would be a good thing for American workers and farmers. As a net-export state, Utah‚Äôs agricultural industry would greatly benefit. Productive meeting discussing USMCA with Mexican Ambassador @Martha_Barcena this morning. https://t.co/cdbvfdSTFCHot dogs are not sandwiches. A hot dog is a thing unto itself. That question was a no-brainer! https://t.co/GNwH9pA7WAThe words of the Declaration of Independence outlined a revolutionary principle: Government is not there for the king or the feudal lord. The government is there for the people. Today, we celebrate the ideals upon which our country was founded. Happy #IndependenceDay üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/4rB6dCSR8wUtah was one of the first states to raise the age of purchasing tobacco to 21. Glad to have @RepBenMcAdams join us in pushing for federal #Tobacco21 legislation. I look forward to working together to get this legislation passed by Congress and signed into law. https://t.co/E11CbH60X1Heartbroken over the tragic news about Ogden native, Army Sgt. 1st Class Elliott Robbins. Our prayers are with his family and loved ones. May we never forget his service and sacrifice for our country. https://t.co/erJWK1WelmPleased to see my #NDAA amendment pass in an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner. Enacting this amendment makes clear to our military, as well as to any potential adversary, that America does not shrink in the face of attack. https://t.co/7hgheD8pn6Tying the president‚Äôs hands in the midst of a crisis is misguided and dangerous. My #NDAA amendment is not an authorization to use military force against Iran. It simply affirms the constitutional authority of the president to keep our military, our citizens, and our allies safe. https://t.co/zvS0fX3xeCLive soon‚Üí I‚Äôll be speaking on the @SenateFloor about my #NDAA amendment to reaffirm the constitutional authorities that any president must have to properly protect and defend our country. Watch: https://t.co/mlS6RtPeXbThere are many aspects of our healthcare system that could use a dose of transparency. Finding ways to reform surprise billing so patients are never in a situation where they receive an outsized bill for emergency services is a top priority of our work in @GOPhelp. https://t.co/mkmWWRcvvl
