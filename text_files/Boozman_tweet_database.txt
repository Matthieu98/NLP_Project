It was a joy to welcome my friend and former teammate, Dr. Robert Lewis, to the Senate to serve as Guest Chaplain and open today's session of the Senate in prayer. I appreciate Robert's ministry &amp; friendship for many years and I'm grateful for the invocation he offered. https://t.co/7XNN6A5jBb

Thanks to @MissAmericaAR Darynne Dahlem for discussing the #opioidepidemic with me today.

Great to see Arkansas celebrating Farm to School Month. Helping young people understand the connection between locally grown food &amp; healthy living is a good initiative and highlights the importance of agriculture for them personally as well as in our economy and everyday lives. https://t.co/vxaucfAfWT
These actions should be met with appropriate measures aimed to alter Turkey‚Äôs behavior, including severe economic sanctions, and our European partners should join us in working to end Turkey‚Äôs actions against the Kurds. 3/3
In fact, ISIS would still be carrying out large-scale carnage in the region without the contributions and sacrifice of the Kurdish people. Turkey's actions put innocent Kurds in harm's way and will further destabilize the region. 2/3
I share the goal of the president &amp; others who want to bring our troops home as quickly as possible. However, honoring our commitments to our allies on the ground is also of paramount importance. The Kurds have been reliable and highly effective partners in the War on Terror. 1/3
I was delighted to join the Fayetteville Lions Club for lunch today. As an optometrist, I‚Äôm grateful for the work it does serving the community and especially in an area that‚Äôs near and dear to my heart: eye care and vision issues.

Sometimes it takes an act of Congress, like the Blue Water Navy bill, to modernize benefits. But new information can also lead VA to expand eligibility. READ my latest column on new momentum for ensuring toxic-exposed veterans get the care they've earned.
