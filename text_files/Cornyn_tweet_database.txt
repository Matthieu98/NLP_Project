Respectfully disagree, unless you argue not getting legislation passed qualifies as “getting something done.”  Enjoyed the exchange. https://t.co/rBIf6avnj1
Beg to differ. Passing partisan bills through one house doesn’t qualify as “getting things done.”  Not in a bicameral legislature. Actually only 1/3 of the way done without likelihood of POTUS signature. https://t.co/tdE5JtSPZL
Then, there are those bills that already have overwhelming bipartisan support, like @SenBlumenthal and my drug price reduction bill, Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act, but @SenSchumer has blocked it for solely political reasons, while calling it a “good” bill. #sad
True.  Record numbers (more than 160) of federal judges nominated and confirmed.  Regarding legislation, there are partisan bills that have passed, where the hard work of building bipartisan consensus has not been yet done.  Those will not pass. https://t.co/5c93UYSBTQ

So why has she proceeded down a partisan impeachment path? The Speaker was clearly overruled by her congressional electors.
Then there is this: Speaker Pelosi said in March 19, 2019 Washington Post story: "[I]mpeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path because it divides the country."
Fair point.  But one reason why presidential impeachment is so rare (this would be the 4th) is the perception that 535 members of Congress are unpicking who electors picked in the 2016 election, and all of this less than a year before the next election. https://t.co/mZBJ0Uj5nh

The second factor is the view among Independents that impeachment reflects the agenda of the political establishment and the media.  Third, as other reporting has suggested, Independents suffer from scandal fatigue and overall confusion.
Three important factors are driving the views of Independents. The first is that, in their view, impeachment distracts from issues they care about.
