While I hope the Administration will act without further delay on its prior proposal to ban flavors that appeal to kids, I will also continue to push for my legislation that bans flavors, ensures that vaping cartridges are tamper-proof, and bans e-cigarettes from schools.
Appreciated @POTUS's efforts to bring together stakeholders &amp; experts to discuss proposals to solve the youth vaping epidemic. Everyone agrees this is a serious problem, but it‚Äôs clear there are differing views about the best way to develop responsible guidelines to protect kids. https://t.co/2xc3y7S0fp
China is exploiting American research institutions and universities to steal U.S. intellectual property, which means American taxpayers are funding China's quest for world dominance.

This evidence does not support @HuaweiUSA‚Äôs claims of a ‚Äúspotless cyber-security track record‚Äù or a sincere desire for dialogue with the U.S. government.
Violating US sanctions on Iran from 2009-2014 and allegedly violating US/UN North Korean sanctions this past summer doesn‚Äôt suggest a sincere interest in cooperating with the United States. https://t.co/8tUhRpXhNe
Spotless? Public reporting suggests otherwise: https://t.co/Xekk9Dee18 https://t.co/xWLpkcMpP4
Some evidence:
- Alleged IP theft from U.S. companies like T Mobile and Cisco

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp

China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.

Tomorrow night (August 21), I'll be holding a town hall in @DraperCity at the Draper City Library (1136 Pioneer Rd.) at 7:00 PM. Looking forward to hearing from local residents. #utpol
Utah‚Äôs biotech companies are making great strides toward innovation within the pharmaceutical industry. Participated in a BioUtah Roundtable with more than 20 of these companies today after touring Biomerics in Salt Lake City. https://t.co/eLszITl3r8
Great to sit down with my friend @BoydMatheson for @KSLnewsradio today discussing conservatism, ways to tackle the debt &amp; deficit, and other news of the day. Thanks for having me on, Boyd! https://t.co/vL773BYNZj
Right now, neither party is focused on the debt and deficit. We spent nearly $300 billion last year on the interest of our debt alone! Tackling our debt must be made a priority. Listen to more of my conversation with @BoydMatheson on @KSLnewsradio‚Üí https://t.co/vvMEZdpNR9
On Tuesday (Aug. 20), I‚Äôll be hosting a town hall in the Uintah Basin to hear from local residents. Join me at the Uintah Conference Center in Vernal (313 E. 200 S) at 6:30 PM. #utpol
Great news for the Beehive State ‚Üí https://t.co/dkMy5CCpLJ
The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE
The nation has witnessed senseless loss of life from recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, and Gilroy. My statement: https://t.co/3XhcfV3fmK
Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583
As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.
As the current longest-serving member of Utah's delegation, Rob Bishop has dedicated his life to public service. As chairman of @NatResources, Rob has been a vital voice for Utah public lands, leading passage of the largest public lands conservation bill in more than a decade.
Ann and I offer our heartfelt condolences to the family of Norma Matheson. As the First Lady of Utah, she led causes that improved the lives of many in our state. Our prayers are with her family, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.
Kept the #PioneerDay celebrations going with my fellow Utahns at last night‚Äôs Flavors of Utah event, hosted by @SenMikeLee. What a great opportunity to show folks in Washington what our state is about and, prove that we really do have the best food in the country! #utpol https://t.co/HkXN8ZRQmE
Within this funding from @HHSGov is a $520,000 grant to @AUCHUtah that will help 12 health centers across the state improve the use of information technology. This is good news for Utah, especially our state's rural communities. https://t.co/6nl9plTvHT
On Pioneer Day, I think specifically of my pioneer ancestors. My great-great grandfather, Miles Romney, designed the famous spiral staircases in the St. George Tabernacle and my 4x-great grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, advanced Brigham Young‚Äôs route to the Salt Lake Valley. https://t.co/3ImQVp6Z4t
Today, we celebrate and honor the legacy of faith, hard work, and innovation of the courageous pioneers who, fearing no toil nor labor, journeyed west into the Salt Lake Valley. Wishing all Utahns a wonderful Pioneer Day! #alliswell https://t.co/qiIwZ3bN1V
Pleased to see Stephen Dickson confirmed as FAA Administrator. I look forward to working with him on issues that impact Utah, like proposed expansions of smaller community airports like Moab, and larger concerns I have regarding air safety, specifically the Boeing 737 Max. https://t.co/jrVibs6zMe
This is a good step to protect young people across the country from the dangers of e-cigarettes. As a society, we have a collective responsibility to keep these harmful products out of our children's hands and protect them from a lifetime of addiction. https://t.co/OsnPT7u5Ec
Access to public lands is a major concern among Utah‚Äôs rural counties. Met with Uintah County commissioners to discuss their plan to maintain and ensure motorized access to the public lands within their county and offer assistance in proving the status of the County‚Äôs roads. https://t.co/MdNdvS0OPH
#USMCA would be of great benefit to Utah‚Äôs agricultural industry. Welcomed my friend Ron Gibson, Utah @FarmBureau President, to the office to discuss USMCA, the important role agriculture plays in food safety, and the current challenges facing the industry. https://t.co/Qlauxkbngi

When @ChrisMurphyCT and I met with Iraqi leaders, they underscored not wanting to become a vassal state of Iran. The Iraqi government needs a strategy to address its relationship with Iran‚Äîwhich includes creating closer ties with other countries in the region. https://t.co/oM9fNBzsgt
While ISIS no longer has a territorial caliphate, Iraq still faces major security challenges. The government must figure out how to sustain a vibrant economy, whether and how to assimilate returning ISIS fighters, and how to counter excessive Iranian influence. https://t.co/Eg8iHxgnvN
Iraq is a place of enormous strategic interest for the U.S. In light of ongoing challenges, the key question now for us is how to best support Iraq‚Äôs efforts to achieve a secure and prosperous future and become a stabilizing force in the region. https://t.co/dFtQeYV6Jm
Iraq has proven for nearly two decades to be the place where vital U.S. interests in the Middle East intersect. Live soon‚Üí I‚Äôll be chairing the @SenateForeign Near East subcommittee hearing with Ranking Member @ChrisMurphyCT on this very topic. Tune in: https://t.co/Q9IZFchd15
We must make a concerted effort to confront the threat China poses to U.S. national security, intellectual property &amp; technology. Pleased the House adopted the Huawei amendment I wrote with @RepGallagher and will work with my colleagues to ensure its inclusion in the final #NDAA.
@JDRFAdvocacy @JDRF I will continue working with my @GOPhelp colleagues on finding ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs and reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for American consumers.
It's outrageous that the cost of insulin has tripled over the past 15 years. For the millions of Americans living with diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life and death.

#USMCA is a marked improvement on NAFTA and ratification would be a good thing for American workers and farmers. As a net-export state, Utah‚Äôs agricultural industry would greatly benefit.

Pleased to see my #NDAA amendment pass in an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner. Enacting this amendment makes clear to our military, as well as to any potential adversary, that America does not shrink in the face of attack. https://t.co/7hgheD8pn6
Tying the president‚Äôs hands in the midst of a crisis is misguided and dangerous. My #NDAA amendment is not an authorization to use military force against Iran. It simply affirms the constitutional authority of the president to keep our military, our citizens, and our allies safe. https://t.co/zvS0fX3xeC
Live soon‚Üí I‚Äôll be speaking on the @SenateFloor about my #NDAA amendment to reaffirm the constitutional authorities that any president must have to properly protect and defend our country. Watch: https://t.co/mlS6RtPeXb

https://t.co/GnSatRoZ2o
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Meanwhile, in related news: "Chickenpox vaccine reactivates in two boys, causing rare meningitis more commonly seen in unvaccinated kids." But NEVER question vaccine safety and efficacy cuz that's "conspiracy theory!"

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO This proves my thread's point &amp; underscores pathetic state of "conservative media," now dominated by snotty toddlers who couldn't bother trying to comprehend meta-analyses, case control &amp; cohort studies, let alone VAERS data. Because feelings &gt; facts.
https://t.co/Ec9C02K0wn
@AmerLifeLeague @RobSchneider @dcexaminer Exactly. Advocates of mandatory jab schemes have gone out of their way to cover up use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacturing.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Protecting national sovereignty begins with protecting family sovereignty--and the freedom to speak in defense of both!
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Informed parents who follow the money &amp; expose truth about #BigPharma 's vaccine racket are defamed &amp; deplatformed by same #BigTech #BigGovernment forces on Left AND Right who target critics of sharia, Antifa &amp; open borders.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3
Look at this: GOP pols cowering &amp; pandering to Daily Beast leftists and lying/denying that they don't know who #LauraLoomer is. Crapweasels!
https://t.co/gARlZDsrs1 /2
Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

While impeachment bread and circuses keep the masses distracted and the Keepers of the Gate stifle dissent &amp; debate, #OpenBordersInc gravy train chugs full speed ahead. https://t.co/8gYmhmTt3y
#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.

It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement.

The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

Always chasing a competitor is not a recipe for success. We can't allow China, a country that refuses to play by the rules, to lead in 5G. U.S. innovators must work with international partners to establish our lead with 5G‚Äîit's of vital importance to our national security. https://t.co/YmX2V8wKYz
Turkey must be held accountable for its aggressive actions in northern Syria. I applaud the House for coming together to pass these sanctions and look forward to the Senate following suit. Congress must step up and stand up for our Kurdish allies. https://t.co/kr67DuAjF7

Keeping these firefighters in my prayers. https://t.co/wokiwRS6AX
It‚Äôs irresponsible for Congress to keep ignoring the impending collapse of our federal trust funds. The TRUST Act would put in place a process to rescue these important programs that millions of Americans rely on. https://t.co/4XgoGzfdr8

ISIS still remains a threat and as such, the decision to abandon our Kurdish allies was a grave mistake. There are serious questions as to how the U.S. will assure that ISIS prison camps remain secure. https://t.co/f5VPa2ehoP
The Administration confirmed today that Turkey ignored our warning and that the U.S. blinked by withdrawing our troops from northern Syria. This has given us a terrible black eye on the world stage. https://t.co/sZ5MeWX1ts
The administration must explain how the decision to withdraw our troops from Syria was reached. Soon, we‚Äôre holding a @SenateForeign hearing on how this decision impacts U.S. security interests moving forward‚Üí

Heroic effort by Trp. Correa. Always grateful for Utah‚Äôs first responders! https://t.co/2gBsPpsYwI
The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.
‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

Tying the president‚Äôs hands in the midst of a crisis is misguided and dangerous. My #NDAA amendment is not an authorization to use military force against Iran.

https://t.co/GnSatRoZ2o
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Meanwhile, in related news: "Chickenpox vaccine reactivates in two boys, causing rare meningitis more commonly seen in unvaccinated kids." But NEVER question vaccine safety and efficacy cuz that's "conspiracy theory!"

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO This proves my thread's point &amp; underscores pathetic state of "conservative media," now dominated by snotty toddlers who couldn't bother trying to comprehend meta-analyses, case control &amp; cohort studies, let alone VAERS data.

https://t.co/Ec9C02K0wn
@AmerLifeLeague @RobSchneider @dcexaminer Exactly. Advocates of mandatory jab schemes have gone out of their way to cover up use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacturing.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Protecting national sovereignty begins with protecting family sovereignty--and the freedom to speak in defense of both!

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN
/6
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

Call me a dumbass. You do you.

Here is one of the biggest cringe moments, showing your willingness to jettison #1A rights in the interest of #AmericaLast agenda -- and implicitly threatening the kid who asked the question. (Complete video directly from the student.)

Brave Blaze host Jon Miller pushes back against SPLC smears of Stephen Miller, calls out identity politics hypocrisy &amp; points out unassailable facts about immigration &amp; crime. Here comes Media Matters. Next will come the ConInc disavowal hounds. https://t.co/hIUsaPBHsg
The GOP #openbordersinc #AmericaLast caucus is hard at work. Where are all the big DC conservative organizations to oppose this - and especially purported #AmericaFirst campus ‚Äúleaders?‚Äù https://t.co/ars69ndSyC
@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP

Walking away from Syria is not the right answer‚Äînot for Syrians, not for our fellow human beings that are children of the same God, and certainly not for the United States. Moving forward, the U.S. strategy in Syria must address these horrific acts. https://t.co/fbyoXaqi89
In Syria:
- Assad‚Äôs government has conducted chemical attacks on its people
- ISIS is regrouping
- Russia and Iran are increasing their power 

The ‚Äúred line‚Äù seems to be more like a green light. We need a concrete, long-term plan for U.S. involvement in Syria. https://t.co/4dmZqQITwJ
In Syria, we face an Assad regime still in power, the ongoing threat of terrorism, and a humanitarian crisis. Live soon‚Üí Senator Murphy and I will be convening a @SenateForeign hearing on the findings of @USIP‚Äôs bipartisan Syria Study Group. Tune in: https://t.co/Za6q8X8nRX

Imposing additional severe sanctions on Iran in response to its attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure is an important step in applying pressure on the regime. We must continue to stand with our partners and allies to hold Iran accountable for its egregious actions. https://t.co/6AXOlFRonz
More than 500 vaping-related illnesses and 7 deaths reported by @CDCgov. Nearly 1 in 4 high schoolers vape regularly. @SenJeffMerkley and I are introducing the ENND Act to protect a new generation from nicotine addiction and educate the public about the dangers of vaping. https://t.co/PFUopjbujT
Nearly 25% of high schoolers are vaping regularly. This is unacceptable. @SenJeffMerkley &amp; I are teaming up on legislation that:
‚úîÔ∏èBans e-cigarettes from containing non-tobacco flavors
‚úîÔ∏èRequires cartridges to be tamper-proof
‚úîÔ∏èApplies existing tobacco excise tax to e-cigarettes https://t.co/EfLYRPjPDI
Perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world is an authoritarian China. We must develop a strategy to dissuade China from imposing its authoritarian system on the world, and work with our allies if they continue on this path of threatening our freedoms. https://t.co/DM2Fnmv7d8

Congratulations to my friend Robert O‚ÄôBrien, who the President has appointed to serve as National Security Advisor. As the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, he has doggedly pursued the release of American hostages abroad. He is a man of the highest integrity.

The protection of individual liberties. May we always remember our founding principles. https://t.co/IJCatYjQXd
Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.
The President made the right call by not directing @USTreasury to index capital gains to inflation, a move that would circumvent Congress, benefit wealthy investors, and add to the debt. My letter to Secretary Mnuchin‚Üí https://t.co/qigZjEmajh

At the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, eight athletes carried in the American flag that was flying above the World Trade Center on 9/11. There was not a dry eye in that stadium.

I spent August traveling across our state‚Äîtalking with people in town halls, meeting with local elected officials, and continuing to work on legislation. One thing is clear: Utahns know what‚Äôs best for Utah. I will keep fighting for what's best for our people and our state. https://t.co/7RhitiRmJ4
Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR
A longtime resident of St. George, Councilman Joe Bowcutt was a leader in his community. Service-oriented, hard-working, genuine. Last week, I met with him to discuss growth within St. George.

Worries and hopes for folks in Bountiful threatened by wildfire. Thanks go to our dedicated firefighters and police. The generosity and good neighborly nature of Utahns evidenced by the city‚Äôs virtually empty shelters.

The #USMCA creates more balanced, reciprocal trade that‚Äôs better for workers in Utah and across the U.S. Last year, Utah exported $14.4 billion worth of goods to the world.

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE

https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV

This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp

The Beehive State is a great place to do business.

Robust local input is crucial in Utah's public land matters. Appreciate @BLMnational's commitment to providing ample opportunity for community input, which will help ensure final plans reflect the right balance of economic, recreational, and natural resource considerations. https://t.co/pn8xpLxmdt
The #USMCA creates more balanced, reciprocal trade that‚Äôs better for workers in Utah and across the U.S. Last year, Utah exported $14.4 billion worth of goods to the world.

CBO confirmed our deficit is on a dangerous trajectory. But right now, neither party seems to be focused on our debt. Inaction is beyond irresponsible.

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE
The nation has witnessed senseless loss of life from recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, and Gilroy. My statement: https://t.co/3XhcfV3fmK
Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583
As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.
As the current longest-serving member of Utah's delegation, Rob Bishop has dedicated his life to public service. As chairman of @NatResources, Rob has been a vital voice for Utah public lands, leading passage of the largest public lands conservation bill in more than a decade.
Ann and I offer our heartfelt condolences to the family of Norma Matheson. As the First Lady of Utah, she led causes that improved the lives of many in our state. Our prayers are with her family, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.
Kept the #PioneerDay celebrations going with my fellow Utahns at last night‚Äôs Flavors of Utah event, hosted by @SenMikeLee. What a great opportunity to show folks in Washington what our state is about and, prove that we really do have the best food in the country! #utpol https://t.co/HkXN8ZRQmE

On Pioneer Day, I think specifically of my pioneer ancestors. My great-great grandfather, Miles Romney, designed the famous spiral staircases in the St. George Tabernacle and my 4x-great grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, advanced Brigham Young‚Äôs route to the Salt Lake Valley. https://t.co/3ImQVp6Z4t

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

This insanity just confirms that the best decision my 19-year-old daughter has made was leaving college after a year to pursue a practical vocational career. https://t.co/mIWepmAFPL
@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3
Look at this: GOP pols cowering &amp; pandering to Daily Beast leftists and lying/denying that they don't know who #LauraLoomer is. Crapweasels!
https://t.co/gARlZDsrs1 /2
Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

While impeachment bread and circuses keep the masses distracted and the Keepers of the Gate stifle dissent &amp; debate, #OpenBordersInc gravy train chugs full speed ahead. https://t.co/8gYmhmTt3y
#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.

It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in

The feeling is more than mutual: We don‚Äôt want Huawei, we don‚Äôt need Huawei, and we shouldn‚Äôt permit Huawei to conduct business here.

Investing retirement savings of military members &amp; federal employees in state-owned firms in China funds their efforts to undermine our security. We must act now to prevent the steering of hardworking Americans' retirement savings into the hands of China. https://t.co/xwEXht15Ef
Our goal with the Climate Solutions Caucus: to craft and advance bipartisan solutions to address climate change. I'm teaming up with @SenatorBraun, @ChrisCoons, @lisamurkowski, @LindseyGrahamSC, @SenatorShaheen, @SenAngusKing, and @SenatorBennet to start this important dialogue. https://t.co/ZRHDl8Ixhd
We also need to consider solutions that will sustain communities that may be impacted by changes in energy technology, and I will continue to meet with folks from our rural and coal mining communities in Utah to hear their perspectives.
Addressing climate change is going to require significant private sector investments and major breakthroughs in innovation and technology. Proud to join the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus to work with my colleagues toward potential solutions for addressing climate change. https://t.co/1DwoB2aAIv

Always chasing a competitor is not a recipe for success. We can't allow China, a country that refuses to play by the rules, to lead in 5G. U.S. innovators must work with international partners to establish our lead with 5G‚Äîit's of vital importance to our national security. https://t.co/YmX2V8wKYz

The Administration confirmed today that Turkey ignored our warning and that the U.S. blinked by withdrawing our troops from northern Syria. This has given us a terrible black eye on the world stage. https://t.co/sZ5MeWX1ts

Heroic effort by Trp. Correa. Always grateful for Utah‚Äôs first responders! https://t.co/2gBsPpsYwI
The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.
‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.

When @ChrisMurphyCT and I met with Iraqi leaders, they underscored not wanting to become a vassal state of Iran. The Iraqi government needs a strategy to address its relationship with Iran‚Äîwhich includes creating closer ties with other countries in the region. https://t.co/oM9fNBzsgt

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

Follow @RefugeeWatcher - vigilant #americafirst watchdog - she has defied Silicon Valley deplatformers to expose refugee racket &amp; fraudsters ripping off our country. https://t.co/bLHKFsG2Md
Every day, Antifa vigilante are making the lives of patriotic citizens hell. @ckferrache , you are not alone &amp; I will keep doing what I can to have your back. If not us, then who? https://t.co/WdQm3XA6sW
You are a fighter  @Rach_IC &amp; I was glad to help you combat the smear machine. We cannot back down. Ever. #TruthWins https://t.co/BauImDmpCR
The GOP establishment is attempting to pull a Covington on so many Proud Boys &amp; young nationalists standing up for our country &amp; refusing to cower in the face of Antifa/ Abolish ICE thugs. Glad to call you friend &amp; compatriot @reallouiehuey https://t.co/zIq2slEBcj
While impeachment bread and circuses keep the masses distracted and the Keepers of the Gate stifle dissent &amp; debate, #OpenBordersInc gravy train chugs full speed ahead. https://t.co/8gYmhmTt3y
#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.
https://t.co/kuHR4jK1HL
Says the #ConInc tool who calls #AmericaFirst kids racists; advocates for massive green card giveaways to cheap labor foreign workers who will vote overwhelming Democrat/socialist &amp; carries ball for #AmericaLast corporatist agenda destroying America. https://t.co/O8xv3MDK1C
Cancel culture continues. #MalkinBannedInBoston - So if there are any conservative venue owners in Boston who want to host a talk on #openbordersinc this Friday, let me know. https://t.co/Zwx02wujQt
Who will stand up and demand #NODACADEAL #nomoreamnesty #americafirst https://t.co/itnkWN0ymf
@Notsoslick2 Thank you!
@ZoomerClips Be specific @andrewklavan - tell me what exactly I said that falls outside the "mainstream" of conservatism. Here's the speech. Tell me what's beyond the pale:
https://t.co/qfdTPzHsNK
We will not be silenced. Stay tuned.
#openbordersinc
#standwithice https://t.co/U52A5u1Ekk
SPLC &amp; company are cheering: Cancel culture comes to Boston. Last-minute bureaucratic excuse-making by Bentley University used as pretext to stifle discussion &amp; debate. Stay tuned. We will NOT be silenced. #openbordersinc @sanctuary_no @JessicaV_CIS @TheKuhnerReport https://t.co/3b2emBRwPV
It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

Call me a dumbass. You do you.

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV https://t.co/JaOmTMTBlY
Here is one of the biggest cringe moments, showing your willingness to jettison #1A rights in the interest of #AmericaLast agenda -- and implicitly threatening the kid who asked the question. (Complete video directly from the student.)

https://t.co/n85Ta11u8N
Brave Blaze host Jon Miller pushes back against SPLC smears of Stephen Miller, calls out identity politics hypocrisy &amp; points out unassailable facts about immigration &amp; crime. Here comes Media Matters. Next will come the ConInc disavowal hounds. https://t.co/hIUsaPBHsg
The GOP #openbordersinc #AmericaLast caucus is hard at work. Where are all the big DC conservative organizations to oppose this - and especially purported #AmericaFirst campus ‚Äúleaders?‚Äù https://t.co/ars69ndSyC
@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo
Attention, Boston: Next #StandWithICE rally is Saturday 11/23 10-11am at the ICE facility in Burlington MA. More info here: https://t.co/cpz3ppjwqV https://t.co/7xiCHYX6ig
Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:
https://t.co/jjK1Kl2I5C
Boston patriots, see you soon!
#AmericaFirst https://t.co/jsnLxCa0GA
A lot of young people have suffered and risked a lot more than me in this battle. I will not abandon or forget them. https://t.co/cqbCfb9Dm8

Thank you, Amy, you‚Äôve been at the forefront combating the forces of evil, hatred, and censorship - grateful for all you do! Never back down. https://t.co/zTNdI1T7pC
Mass migration demographics doom American sovereignty. That was message of UCLA speech that got me blacklisted by @yaf - it‚Äôs message of #OpenBordersInc &amp; my CPAC speech. And it‚Äôs the message of kids being smeared on campuses. Establishment GOP‚Äôs solution? Shoot the messengers. https://t.co/5YEawo7dgL
@LibertarianBlue Thanks, Allum!
@jeremycarl4 Thank you, Jeremy!
@johnhawkinsrwn Thanks John!
@johnfulks99 @bridgeinit Never.

Families like mine, which revere rule of law, common traditions, constitutional principles, 1 identity &amp; 1 tongue, have been replaced by militantly unassimilable &amp; hostile generations of future Democrat voters whose tribal allegiance to the Left has only hardened over time. https://t.co/aBHO5BLlO0

NEW POLL: Polling from @RetireCoalition shows Americans overwhelmingly (92%) believe protecting retirees is essential to our economy, and 3 in 4 Ohioans say multiemployer pensions are in crisis and America can‚Äôt afford to wait. https://t.co/lNPeb0doK3
Watch my full @TeamCavuto interview to learn more about the multiemployer pension crisis and why Americans want to solve it now. There‚Äôs got to be a shared solution. https://t.co/F63YYa7t6a

Correct. https://t.co/QPchfUmmVD
The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in
@CNNBusiness. https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0
Left unchecked, today's #pensioncrisis will decimate the retirement future of millions. That's why I joined @JoeCrowleyNY to launch @RetireCoalition and sound the alarm that inaction leaves Americans out to dry. Read our @CNNBusiness piece to learn more: https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0
Americans need an urgent solution to the multiemployer pension plan crisis that helps us protect millions of miners, truckers, bakers, construction workers, and musicians' hard-earned retirement. Learn more about @RetireCoalition here: https://t.co/865fRRMCYZ #RetirementSecurity

.@MeritMedical is a Utah success story. Visited it‚Äôs South Jordan headquarters to discuss with workers ways to sustain economic growth and job creation, as well as the impact of the medical device tax. Impressed by the services Merit provides its employees. https://t.co/lVKrftnsI2
Vaping has nearly doubled among young people in Utah over the last five years. Appreciate the local officials and health experts who updated me on their anti-vaping efforts in Utah, and I look forward to continuing our work to keep children from getting hooked on these products. https://t.co/hJTOYQtBmb
Tragically, Utah had its first vaping-related death this week. Sitting down with health experts from @UtahDepOfHealth, @UofUHealth, @AmericanCancer, and more at @PrimaryChildren in Salt Lake City to discuss anti-vaping efforts in Utah and potential action at the federal level. https://t.co/nNKGq7uaRh
Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Walking away from Syria is not the right answer‚Äînot for Syrians, not for our fellow human beings that are children of the same God, and certainly not for the United States. Moving forward, the U.S. strategy in Syria must address these horrific acts. https://t.co/fbyoXaqi89
In Syria:
- Assad‚Äôs government has conducted chemical attacks on its people

More than 500 vaping-related illnesses and 7 deaths reported by @CDCgov. Nearly 1 in 4 high schoolers vape regularly. @SenJeffMerkley and I are introducing the ENND Act to protect a new generation from nicotine addiction and educate the public about the dangers of vaping. https://t.co/PFUopjbujT
Nearly 25% of high schoolers are vaping regularly. This is unacceptable. @SenJeffMerkley &amp; I are teaming up on legislation that:

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

I spent August traveling across our state‚Äîtalking with people in town halls, meeting with local elected officials, and continuing to work on legislation.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4

On the anniversary of #September11th, we honor all of those who lost their lives‚Äîincluding the first responders who rushed into harm‚Äôs way. We also salute the brave men and women who have served in defense of our great nation since that day. #NeverForget https://t.co/zJzbJME5Cj

I spent August traveling across our state‚Äîtalking with people in town halls, meeting with local elected officials, and continuing to work on legislation. One thing is clear: Utahns know what‚Äôs best for Utah. I will keep fighting for what's best for our people and our state. https://t.co/7RhitiRmJ4
Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR
A longtime resident of St. George, Councilman Joe Bowcutt was a leader in his community. Service-oriented, hard-working, genuine. Last week, I met with him to discuss growth within St. George.

On #LaborDay, we honor the achievements of American workers. Utah‚Äôs unemployment rate is below 3%. Every day, but especially today, I am grateful for the hardworking Utahns, and the employers, large and small, that remain committed to creating jobs in our great state. https://t.co/3fU88WGTo1
Worries and hopes for folks in Bountiful threatened by wildfire. Thanks go to our dedicated firefighters and police. The generosity and good neighborly nature of Utahns evidenced by the city‚Äôs virtually empty shelters.

The #USMCA creates more balanced, reciprocal trade that‚Äôs better for workers in Utah and across the U.S. Last year, Utah exported $14.4 billion worth of goods to the world.

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE

Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583
As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3

Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw

After waiting months for @US_FDA guidance on a vaping flavor ban, news reports indicate the Administration may no longer act. I intend to ask Dr. Hahn about his plan to address the rise in youth nicotine addiction at his @GOPHELP confirmation hearing soon: https://t.co/FiUWV4P6V5
The Senate just unanimously passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to show our support for the pro-democracy protestors. These protests are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression and censorship and remind us of how precious freedom truly is.

Convened Utah collegiate athletic directors for a discussion on how to compensate student athletes. We have a mutual concern: how to preserve the integrity of collegiate sports. I will keep working hand in hand with this group and the @NCAA on a solution that achieves both. https://t.co/B6SftidLB5
Appreciated @NCAA President Emmert taking the time to hear my views about the need for student athlete compensation.

This evidence does not support @HuaweiUSA‚Äôs claims of a ‚Äúspotless cyber-security track record‚Äù or a sincere desire for dialogue with the U.S. government.
Violating US sanctions on Iran from 2009-2014 and allegedly violating US/UN North Korean sanctions this past summer doesn‚Äôt suggest a sincere interest in cooperating with the United States. https://t.co/8tUhRpXhNe
Spotless? Public reporting suggests otherwise: https://t.co/Xekk9Dee18 https://t.co/xWLpkcMpP4
Some evidence:
- Alleged IP theft from U.S. companies like T Mobile and Cisco
- Violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea
- Huawei technology is a direct channel of data from users to CCP
- Jailing of Canadian citizens by CCP as retaliation for Canada enforcing its laws https://t.co/8KpgBcN7rW

Soon, I'll be talking with @kslnewsradio about today's @GOPHELP hearing with the @US_FDA and @CDCgov to dicuss ways to combat the vaping epidemic. Hope you'll tune in: https://t.co/MMS8trls0Q
The rate of vaping-related illness in Utah is 6x the national average. Our country now has more than 5 million young people addicted to nicotine. This is unacceptable. Congress, the @US_FDA, and @CDCgov need to work together to address this epidemic. https://t.co/eibHnJ8eqP
Congress needs to act now to address the vaping epidemic. My legislation:
‚úîÔ∏èBans non-tobacco vaping flavors
‚úîÔ∏èRequires cartridges to be tamper-proof
‚úîÔ∏èApplies excise tax to e-cigarettes
‚úîÔ∏èUses the tax for education
 
Glad @US_FDA and @CDCgov agree this bill would help the public. https://t.co/5nLIz9DQe5
We must protect our young people from the dangers of vaping. Live now‚Üí our @GOPHELP hearing examining the @US_FDA and @CDCgov's response to lung illnesses and rising youth e-cigarette use. https://t.co/evYqtAaE6R

The feeling is more than mutual: We don‚Äôt want Huawei, we don‚Äôt need Huawei, and we shouldn‚Äôt permit Huawei to conduct business here.

Always chasing a competitor is not a recipe for success. We can't allow China, a country that refuses to play by the rules, to lead in 5G. U.S. innovators must work with international partners to establish our lead with 5G‚Äîit's of vital importance to our national security. https://t.co/YmX2V8wKYz

ISIS still remains a threat and as such, the decision to abandon our Kurdish allies was a grave mistake. There are serious questions as to how the U.S. will assure that ISIS prison camps remain secure. https://t.co/f5VPa2ehoP
The Administration confirmed today that Turkey ignored our warning and that the U.S. blinked by withdrawing our troops from northern Syria. This has given us a terrible black eye on the world stage. https://t.co/sZ5MeWX1ts
The administration must explain how the decision to withdraw our troops from Syria was reached. Soon, we‚Äôre holding a @SenateForeign hearing on how this decision impacts U.S. security interests moving forward‚Üí
https://t.co/mexJoUrZpD
Heroic effort by Trp. Correa. Always grateful for Utah‚Äôs first responders! https://t.co/2gBsPpsYwI
The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.
‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power
- Russia has assumed control of our previous military positions

The ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô is far from a victory. https://t.co/jjo7nLJSm0

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE
The nation has witnessed senseless loss of life from recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, and Gilroy. My statement: https://t.co/3XhcfV3fmK
Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583
As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.
As the current longest-serving member of Utah's delegation, Rob Bishop has dedicated his life to public service. As chairman of @NatResources, Rob has been a vital voice for Utah public lands, leading passage of the largest public lands conservation bill in more than a decade.
Ann and I offer our heartfelt condolences to the family of Norma Matheson. As the First Lady of Utah, she led causes that improved the lives of many in our state. Our prayers are with her family, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.
Kept the #PioneerDay celebrations going with my fellow Utahns at last night‚Äôs Flavors of Utah event, hosted by @SenMikeLee. What a great opportunity to show folks in Washington what our state is about and, prove that we really do have the best food in the country! #utpol https://t.co/HkXN8ZRQmE
Within this funding from @HHSGov is a $520,000 grant to @AUCHUtah that will help 12 health centers across the state improve the use of information technology. This is good news for Utah, especially our state's rural communities. https://t.co/6nl9plTvHT
On Pioneer Day, I think specifically of my pioneer ancestors. My great-great grandfather, Miles Romney, designed the famous spiral staircases in the St. George Tabernacle and my 4x-great grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, advanced Brigham Young‚Äôs route to the Salt Lake Valley. https://t.co/3ImQVp6Z4t

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S
/11
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3
Look at this: GOP pols cowering &amp; pandering to Daily Beast leftists and lying/denying that they don't know who #LauraLoomer is. Crapweasels!
https://t.co/gARlZDsrs1 /2
Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

While impeachment bread and circuses keep the masses distracted and the Keepers of the Gate stifle dissent &amp; debate, #OpenBordersInc gravy train chugs full speed ahead. https://t.co/8gYmhmTt3y
#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.

SPLC &amp; company are cheering: Cancel culture comes to Boston. Last-minute bureaucratic excuse-making by Bentley University used as pretext to stifle discussion &amp; debate. Stay tuned. We will NOT be silenced. #openbordersinc @sanctuary_no @JessicaV_CIS @TheKuhnerReport https://t.co/3b2emBRwPV
It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

Call me a dumbass. You do you.

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV https://t.co/JaOmTMTBlY
Here is one of the biggest cringe moments, showing your willingness to jettison #1A rights in the interest of #AmericaLast agenda -- and implicitly threatening the kid who asked the question. (Complete video directly from the student.)

Brave Blaze host Jon Miller pushes back against SPLC smears of Stephen Miller, calls out identity politics hypocrisy &amp; points out unassailable facts about immigration &amp; crime. Here comes Media Matters. Next will come the ConInc disavowal hounds. https://t.co/hIUsaPBHsg
The GOP #openbordersinc #AmericaLast caucus is hard at work. Where are all the big DC conservative organizations to oppose this - and especially purported #AmericaFirst campus ‚Äúleaders?‚Äù https://t.co/ars69ndSyC
@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

Mass migration demographics doom American sovereignty. That was message of UCLA speech that got me blacklisted by @yaf - it‚Äôs message of #OpenBordersInc &amp; my CPAC speech.

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in

Left unchecked, today's #pensioncrisis will decimate the retirement future of millions. That's why I joined @JoeCrowleyNY to launch @RetireCoalition and sound the alarm that inaction leaves Americans out to dry. Read our @CNNBusiness piece to learn more: https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0

Keeping these firefighters in my prayers. https://t.co/wokiwRS6AX
It‚Äôs irresponsible for Congress to keep ignoring the impending collapse of our federal trust funds. The TRUST Act would put in place a process to rescue these important programs that millions of Americans rely on. https://t.co/4XgoGzfdr8

ISIS still remains a threat and as such, the decision to abandon our Kurdish allies was a grave mistake. There are serious questions as to how the U.S. will assure that ISIS prison camps remain secure. https://t.co/f5VPa2ehoP
The Administration confirmed today that Turkey ignored our warning and that the U.S. blinked by withdrawing our troops from northern Syria. This has given us a terrible black eye on the world stage. https://t.co/sZ5MeWX1ts

Heroic effort by Trp. Correa. Always grateful for Utah‚Äôs first responders! https://t.co/2gBsPpsYwI
The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.
‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power
- Russia has assumed control of our previous military positions

The ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô is far from a victory. https://t.co/jjo7nLJSm0

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Good point:
https://t.co/GnSatRoZ2o
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Meanwhile, in related news: "Chickenpox vaccine reactivates in two boys, causing rare meningitis more commonly seen in unvaccinated kids." But NEVER question vaccine safety and efficacy cuz that's "conspiracy theory!"

https://t.co/cKk4oTH0nJ
@JonathanFalcons @RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Same thing happened to us in 2004 when we questioned timing of Hep B shot for my newborn son ==&gt;
https://t.co/LZnmDCwzIB
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Staunch, informed pro-life conservatives have long challenged the use of aborted fetal cell lines to manufacture vaccines ==&gt;

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO This proves my thread's point &amp; underscores pathetic state of "conservative media," now dominated by snotty toddlers who couldn't bother trying to comprehend meta-analyses, case control &amp; cohort studies, let alone VAERS data. Because feelings &gt; facts.
https://t.co/Ec9C02K0wn
@AmerLifeLeague @RobSchneider @dcexaminer Exactly. Advocates of mandatory jab schemes have gone out of their way to cover up use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacturing.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Protecting national sovereignty begins with protecting family sovereignty--and the freedom to speak in defense of both!
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Informed parents who follow the money &amp; expose truth about #BigPharma 's vaccine racket are defamed &amp; deplatformed by same #BigTech #BigGovernment forces on Left AND Right who target critics of sharia, Antifa &amp; open borders. It's all of a piece. See?

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S
/11
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj
/7
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN
/6
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4

@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo
Attention, Boston: Next #StandWithICE rally is Saturday 11/23 10-11am at the ICE facility in Burlington MA. More info here: https://t.co/cpz3ppjwqV https://t.co/7xiCHYX6ig
Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:
https://t.co/jjK1Kl2I5C

Mass migration demographics doom American sovereignty. That was message of UCLA speech that got me blacklisted by @yaf - it‚Äôs message of #OpenBordersInc &amp; my CPAC speech.

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in
@CNNBusiness. https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0
Left unchecked, today's #pensioncrisis will decimate the retirement future of millions. That's why I joined @JoeCrowleyNY to launch @RetireCoalition and sound the alarm that inaction leaves Americans out to dry. Read our @CNNBusiness piece to learn more: https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0
Americans need an urgent solution to the multiemployer pension plan crisis that helps us protect millions of miners, truckers, bakers, construction workers, and musicians' hard-earned retirement. Learn more about @RetireCoalition here: https://t.co/865fRRMCYZ #RetirementSecurity

This is the real story behind the Do Nothing Democrats! https://t.co/4tPTICdSR1
Too bad we didn‚Äôt have the G-7 here. I offered to pick up the entire cost, would have saved at least $35,000,000 for the USA. Best location. Very stupid people thought I would gain. Wrong! Looking at Camp David. Will announce soon. https://t.co/8RF7IHVyxN
Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment, especially in swing states. 75% to 25%. Thank you!
Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, AOC and the rest of the Democrats are not getting important legislation done, hence, the Do Nothing Democrats. USMCA, National Defense Authorization Act, Gun Safety, Prescription Drug Prices, &amp; Infrastructure are dead in the water because of the Dems!

....Sondland said Trump told him. None of this will move the needle for anyone. And now Dems in Swing Districts head home for Thanksgiving to hear from voters. Pelosi &amp; Co. are putting on a show to appease the Democratic base instead of doing the work ALL Americans need done.‚Äù
....ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID ANYTHING IMPEACHABLE. No one heard him order a quid pro quo. No one offered a convincing reason why Trump‚Äôs interest in having Ukraine probe potential cortuption warrants Impeachment. ‚ÄúI want no Quid Pro Quo‚Äù Ambassador....
NEW YORK POST EDITORIAL. ‚ÄúWorse Than Pointless. All those hours of televised testimony plainly failed on their announced goal: to change American‚Äôs minds. Part of the problem is that Democrats already leaked the best evidence they had. More important, NOT ONE WITNESS OFFERED.....
Daniel Cameron, who just won the A.G. race in the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a young and very talented political star. You will be hearing much from Cameron in the years to come!
.....Brennan, too. And the Whistleblower also worked for Susan Rice. It‚Äôs an understatement to say that this is a Witch Hunt.‚Äù @IngrahamAngle  They spied on my campaign!
‚ÄúThe Democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing. The Whistleblower, the guy who took his case to Schiff‚Äôs staff first, is what really blows the lid off this entire saga. He worked for Biden on Ukraine policy when Biden was VP. He worked for deep state henchman John
Joe Concha, The Hill: ‚ÄúIn Emerson College Poll, Impeachment among independents, 49% Oppose, 34% Support. You see why Pelosi is reluctant to go in with this. Dems have to go home and explain why they haven‚Äôt done something on Opioid crisis, drug prices, USMCA, the Border, etc.
Adam Schiff will be compelled to testify should the Democrats decide, despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect), to go forward with the Impeachment Hoax. Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment!
‚ÄúThe support for Impeachment is not there. I think the Democrats will have to come up with a new game plan.‚Äù @jasoninthehouse @FoxNews

...While we had the first prescription drug price decrease in 50 years, Americans still pay far too much for drugs ‚Äì other countries pay far less ‚Äì that is WRONG! We will soon be putting more options on the table...
.@SecAzar and I will soon release a plan to let Florida and other States import prescription drugs that are MUCH CHEAPER than what we have now! Hard-working Americans don‚Äôt deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need. We are fighting DAILY to make sure this HAPPENS...

Corrupt politician Adam Schiff‚Äôs lies are growing by the day. Keep fighting tough, Republicans, you are dealing with human scum who have taken Due Process and all of the Republican Party‚Äôs rights away from us during the most unfair hearings in American History......

While I hope the Administration will act without further delay on its prior proposal to ban flavors that appeal to kids, I will also continue to push for my legislation that bans flavors, ensures that vaping cartridges are tamper-proof, and bans e-cigarettes from schools.
Appreciated @POTUS's efforts to bring together stakeholders &amp; experts to discuss proposals to solve the youth vaping epidemic. Everyone agrees this is a serious problem, but it‚Äôs clear there are differing views about the best way to develop responsible guidelines to protect kids. https://t.co/2xc3y7S0fp

This evidence does not support @HuaweiUSA‚Äôs claims of a ‚Äúspotless cyber-security track record‚Äù or a sincere desire for dialogue with the U.S. government.
Violating US sanctions on Iran from 2009-2014 and allegedly violating US/UN North Korean sanctions this past summer doesn‚Äôt suggest a sincere interest in cooperating with the United States. https://t.co/8tUhRpXhNe
Spotless? Public reporting suggests otherwise: https://t.co/Xekk9Dee18 https://t.co/xWLpkcMpP4
Some evidence:
- Alleged IP theft from U.S. companies like T Mobile and Cisco

The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations.

This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp

China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.

Imposing additional severe sanctions on Iran in response to its attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure is an important step in applying pressure on the regime. We must continue to stand with our partners and allies to hold Iran accountable for its egregious actions. https://t.co/6AXOlFRonz
More than 500 vaping-related illnesses and 7 deaths reported by @CDCgov. Nearly 1 in 4 high schoolers vape regularly. @SenJeffMerkley and I are introducing the ENND Act to protect a new generation from nicotine addiction and educate the public about the dangers of vaping. https://t.co/PFUopjbujT
Nearly 25% of high schoolers are vaping regularly. This is unacceptable. @SenJeffMerkley &amp; I are teaming up on legislation that:
‚úîÔ∏èBans e-cigarettes from containing non-tobacco flavors
‚úîÔ∏èRequires cartridges to be tamper-proof
‚úîÔ∏èApplies existing tobacco excise tax to e-cigarettes https://t.co/EfLYRPjPDI
Perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world is an authoritarian China. We must develop a strategy to dissuade China from imposing its authoritarian system on the world, and work with our allies if they continue on this path of threatening our freedoms. https://t.co/DM2Fnmv7d8

Congratulations to my friend Robert O‚ÄôBrien, who the President has appointed to serve as National Security Advisor. As the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, he has doggedly pursued the release of American hostages abroad. He is a man of the highest integrity.

The protection of individual liberties. May we always remember our founding principles. https://t.co/IJCatYjQXd
Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.
The President made the right call by not directing @USTreasury to index capital gains to inflation, a move that would circumvent Congress, benefit wealthy investors, and add to the debt. My letter to Secretary Mnuchin‚Üí https://t.co/qigZjEmajh

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE

https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious.

Impeachment Witch Hunt is now OVER! Ambassador Sondland asks U.S. President (me): ‚ÄúWhat do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas &amp; theories. What do you want? It was a very abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood. He (the President) just said,‚Äù...

While I hope the Administration will act without further delay on its prior proposal to ban flavors that appeal to kids, I will also continue to push for my legislation that bans flavors, ensures that vaping cartridges are tamper-proof, and bans e-cigarettes from schools.
Appreciated @POTUS's efforts to bring together stakeholders &amp; experts to discuss proposals to solve the youth vaping epidemic. Everyone agrees this is a serious problem, but it‚Äôs clear there are differing views about the best way to develop responsible guidelines to protect kids. https://t.co/2xc3y7S0fp
China is exploiting American research institutions and universities to steal U.S. intellectual property, which means American taxpayers are funding China's quest for world dominance.

This evidence does not support @HuaweiUSA‚Äôs claims of a ‚Äúspotless cyber-security track record‚Äù or a sincere desire for dialogue with the U.S. government.
Violating US sanctions on Iran from 2009-2014 and allegedly violating US/UN North Korean sanctions this past summer doesn‚Äôt suggest a sincere interest in cooperating with the United States. https://t.co/8tUhRpXhNe
Spotless? Public reporting suggests otherwise: https://t.co/Xekk9Dee18 https://t.co/xWLpkcMpP4
Some evidence:
- Alleged IP theft from U.S. companies like T Mobile and Cisco

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp

China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.

CBO confirmed our deficit is on a dangerous trajectory. But right now, neither party seems to be focused on our debt. Inaction is beyond irresponsible.

Right now, neither party is focused on the debt and deficit. We spent nearly $300 billion last year on the interest of our debt alone! Tackling our debt must be made a priority. Listen to more of my conversation with @BoydMatheson on @KSLnewsradio‚Üí https://t.co/vvMEZdpNR9

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE
The nation has witnessed senseless loss of life from recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, and Gilroy. My statement: https://t.co/3XhcfV3fmK
Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583
As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.
As the current longest-serving member of Utah's delegation, Rob Bishop has dedicated his life to public service. As chairman of @NatResources, Rob has been a vital voice for Utah public lands, leading passage of the largest public lands conservation bill in more than a decade.

On Pioneer Day, I think specifically of my pioneer ancestors. My great-great grandfather, Miles Romney, designed the famous spiral staircases in the St. George Tabernacle and my 4x-great grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, advanced Brigham Young‚Äôs route to the Salt Lake Valley. https://t.co/3ImQVp6Z4t

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

This insanity just confirms that the best decision my 19-year-old daughter has made was leaving college after a year to pursue a practical vocational career. https://t.co/mIWepmAFPL
@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3
Look at this: GOP pols cowering &amp; pandering to Daily Beast leftists and lying/denying that they don't know who #LauraLoomer is. Crapweasels!
https://t.co/gARlZDsrs1 /2
Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

While impeachment bread and circuses keep the masses distracted and the Keepers of the Gate stifle dissent &amp; debate, #OpenBordersInc gravy train chugs full speed ahead. https://t.co/8gYmhmTt3y
#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.

It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in

Addressing climate change is going to require significant private sector investments and major breakthroughs in innovation and technology. Proud to join the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus to work with my colleagues toward potential solutions for addressing climate change. https://t.co/1DwoB2aAIv

Always chasing a competitor is not a recipe for success. We can't allow China, a country that refuses to play by the rules, to lead in 5G. U.S. innovators must work with international partners to establish our lead with 5G‚Äîit's of vital importance to our national security. https://t.co/YmX2V8wKYz

The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.

‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

Iraq is a place of enormous strategic interest for the U.S. In light of ongoing challenges, the key question now for us is how to best support Iraq‚Äôs efforts to achieve a secure and prosperous future and become a stabilizing force in the region. https://t.co/dFtQeYV6Jm
Iraq has proven for nearly two decades to be the place where vital U.S. interests in the Middle East intersect. Live soon‚Üí I‚Äôll be chairing the @SenateForeign Near East subcommittee hearing with Ranking Member @ChrisMurphyCT on this very topic. Tune in: https://t.co/Q9IZFchd15
We must make a concerted effort to confront the threat China poses to U.S. national security, intellectual property &amp; technology. Pleased the House adopted the Huawei amendment I wrote with @RepGallagher and will work with my colleagues to ensure its inclusion in the final #NDAA.
@JDRFAdvocacy @JDRF I will continue working with my @GOPhelp colleagues on finding ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs and reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for American consumers.
It's outrageous that the cost of insulin has tripled over the past 15 years. For the millions of Americans living with diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life and death. Appreciated learning from and hearing the stories of these young Utahns living with Type 1 diabetes. https://t.co/aRFoGPPxsu
#USMCA is a marked improvement on NAFTA and ratification would be a good thing for American workers and farmers. As a net-export state, Utah‚Äôs agricultural industry would greatly benefit.

Pleased to see my #NDAA amendment pass in an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner. Enacting this amendment makes clear to our military, as well as to any potential adversary, that America does not shrink in the face of attack. https://t.co/7hgheD8pn6
Tying the president‚Äôs hands in the midst of a crisis is misguided and dangerous. My #NDAA amendment is not an authorization to use military force against Iran. It simply affirms the constitutional authority of the president to keep our military, our citizens, and our allies safe. https://t.co/zvS0fX3xeC

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Good point:
https://t.co/GnSatRoZ2o
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Meanwhile, in related news: "Chickenpox vaccine reactivates in two boys, causing rare meningitis more commonly seen in unvaccinated kids." But NEVER question vaccine safety and efficacy cuz that's "conspiracy theory!"

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO This proves my thread's point &amp; underscores pathetic state of "conservative media," now dominated by snotty toddlers who couldn't bother trying to comprehend meta-analyses, case control &amp; cohort studies, let alone VAERS data. Because feelings &gt; facts.
https://t.co/Ec9C02K0wn
@AmerLifeLeague @RobSchneider @dcexaminer Exactly. Advocates of mandatory jab schemes have gone out of their way to cover up use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacturing.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Protecting national sovereignty begins with protecting family sovereignty--and the freedom to speak in defense of both!
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Informed parents who follow the money &amp; expose truth about #BigPharma 's vaccine racket are defamed &amp; deplatformed by same #BigTech #BigGovernment forces on Left AND Right who target critics of sharia, Antifa &amp; open borders.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S
/11
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj
/7
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN
/6
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@RobSchneider Last week, an ignorant snot from the "conservative" @dcexaminer attacked my work challenging HPV/ Gardasil mandates &amp; pro-vaccine orthodoxy from pharma lobbyists &amp; their shills in politics. Pure ad hominem. No facts: /2 https://t.co/kusDhRi4bC

Who will stand up and demand #NODACADEAL #nomoreamnesty #americafirst https://t.co/itnkWN0ymf
@Notsoslick2 Thank you!
@ZoomerClips Be specific @andrewklavan - tell me what exactly I said that falls outside the "mainstream" of conservatism. Here's the speech. Tell me what's beyond the pale:
https://t.co/qfdTPzHsNK
We will not be silenced. Stay tuned.
#openbordersinc
#standwithice https://t.co/U52A5u1Ekk
SPLC &amp; company are cheering: Cancel culture comes to Boston. Last-minute bureaucratic excuse-making by Bentley University used as pretext to stifle discussion &amp; debate. Stay tuned. We will NOT be silenced. #openbordersinc @sanctuary_no @JessicaV_CIS @TheKuhnerReport https://t.co/3b2emBRwPV
It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

Call me a dumbass. You do you.

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV https://t.co/JaOmTMTBlY
Here is one of the biggest cringe moments, showing your willingness to jettison #1A rights in the interest of #AmericaLast agenda -- and implicitly threatening the kid who asked the question. (Complete video directly from the student.)

https://t.co/n85Ta11u8N
Brave Blaze host Jon Miller pushes back against SPLC smears of Stephen Miller, calls out identity politics hypocrisy &amp; points out unassailable facts about immigration &amp; crime. Here comes Media Matters. Next will come the ConInc disavowal hounds. https://t.co/hIUsaPBHsg
The GOP #openbordersinc #AmericaLast caucus is hard at work. Where are all the big DC conservative organizations to oppose this - and especially purported #AmericaFirst campus ‚Äúleaders?‚Äù https://t.co/ars69ndSyC
@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in

Left unchecked, today's #pensioncrisis will decimate the retirement future of millions. That's why I joined @JoeCrowleyNY to launch @RetireCoalition and sound the alarm that inaction leaves Americans out to dry. Read our @CNNBusiness piece to learn more: https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0

The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Walking away from Syria is not the right answer‚Äînot for Syrians, not for our fellow human beings that are children of the same God, and certainly not for the United States. Moving forward, the U.S. strategy in Syria must address these horrific acts. https://t.co/fbyoXaqi89
In Syria:
- Assad‚Äôs government has conducted chemical attacks on its people
- ISIS is regrouping

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

I spent August traveling across our state‚Äîtalking with people in town halls, meeting with local elected officials, and continuing to work on legislation.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.

https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV

FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious.

On #LaborDay, we honor the achievements of American workers. Utah‚Äôs unemployment rate is below 3%. Every day, but especially today, I am grateful for the hardworking Utahns, and the employers, large and small, that remain committed to creating jobs in our great state. https://t.co/3fU88WGTo1
Worries and hopes for folks in Bountiful threatened by wildfire. Thanks go to our dedicated firefighters and police. The generosity and good neighborly nature of Utahns evidenced by the city‚Äôs virtually empty shelters.
Senate Democrats‚Äô recent threat to pack to the Supreme Court is a further attempt to rig the Court based on political preferences. I stand with my colleagues in condemning their actions. An independent Judicial Branch is a critical foundation of our democracy. https://t.co/iiXApMi7oh

The #USMCA creates more balanced, reciprocal trade that‚Äôs better for workers in Utah and across the U.S. Last year, Utah exported $14.4 billion worth of goods to the world.

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE

Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583
As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3

Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant.

Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw

This evidence does not support @HuaweiUSA‚Äôs claims of a ‚Äúspotless cyber-security track record‚Äù or a sincere desire for dialogue with the U.S. government.
Violating US sanctions on Iran from 2009-2014 and allegedly violating US/UN North Korean sanctions this past summer doesn‚Äôt suggest a sincere interest in cooperating with the United States. https://t.co/8tUhRpXhNe
Spotless? Public reporting suggests otherwise: https://t.co/Xekk9Dee18 https://t.co/xWLpkcMpP4
Some evidence:
- Alleged IP theft from U.S. companies like T Mobile and Cisco
- Violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea
- Huawei technology is a direct channel of data from users to CCP
- Jailing of Canadian citizens by CCP as retaliation for Canada enforcing its laws https://t.co/8KpgBcN7rW

Soon, I'll be talking with @kslnewsradio about today's @GOPHELP hearing with the @US_FDA and @CDCgov to dicuss ways to combat the vaping epidemic. Hope you'll tune in: https://t.co/MMS8trls0Q
The rate of vaping-related illness in Utah is 6x the national average. Our country now has more than 5 million young people addicted to nicotine. This is unacceptable. Congress, the @US_FDA, and @CDCgov need to work together to address this epidemic. https://t.co/eibHnJ8eqP
Congress needs to act now to address the vaping epidemic. My legislation:
‚úîÔ∏èBans non-tobacco vaping flavors
‚úîÔ∏èRequires cartridges to be tamper-proof
‚úîÔ∏èApplies excise tax to e-cigarettes
‚úîÔ∏èUses the tax for education
 
Glad @US_FDA and @CDCgov agree this bill would help the public. https://t.co/5nLIz9DQe5
We must protect our young people from the dangers of vaping. Live now‚Üí our @GOPHELP hearing examining the @US_FDA and @CDCgov's response to lung illnesses and rising youth e-cigarette use. https://t.co/evYqtAaE6R

The feeling is more than mutual: We don‚Äôt want Huawei, we don‚Äôt need Huawei, and we shouldn‚Äôt permit Huawei to conduct business here.

Always chasing a competitor is not a recipe for success. We can't allow China, a country that refuses to play by the rules, to lead in 5G. U.S. innovators must work with international partners to establish our lead with 5G‚Äîit's of vital importance to our national security. https://t.co/YmX2V8wKYz

Keeping these firefighters in my prayers. https://t.co/wokiwRS6AX
It‚Äôs irresponsible for Congress to keep ignoring the impending collapse of our federal trust funds. The TRUST Act would put in place a process to rescue these important programs that millions of Americans rely on. https://t.co/4XgoGzfdr8

ISIS still remains a threat and as such, the decision to abandon our Kurdish allies was a grave mistake. There are serious questions as to how the U.S. will assure that ISIS prison camps remain secure. https://t.co/f5VPa2ehoP
The Administration confirmed today that Turkey ignored our warning and that the U.S. blinked by withdrawing our troops from northern Syria. This has given us a terrible black eye on the world stage. https://t.co/sZ5MeWX1ts
The administration must explain how the decision to withdraw our troops from Syria was reached. Soon, we‚Äôre holding a @SenateForeign hearing on how this decision impacts U.S. security interests moving forward‚Üí
https://t.co/mexJoUrZpD
Heroic effort by Trp. Correa. Always grateful for Utah‚Äôs first responders! https://t.co/2gBsPpsYwI
The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.
‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power
- Russia has assumed control of our previous military positions

The ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô is far from a victory. https://t.co/jjo7nLJSm0

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

As the current longest-serving member of Utah's delegation, Rob Bishop has dedicated his life to public service. As chairman of @NatResources, Rob has been a vital voice for Utah public lands, leading passage of the largest public lands conservation bill in more than a decade.
Ann and I offer our heartfelt condolences to the family of Norma Matheson. As the First Lady of Utah, she led causes that improved the lives of many in our state. Our prayers are with her family, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.
Kept the #PioneerDay celebrations going with my fellow Utahns at last night‚Äôs Flavors of Utah event, hosted by @SenMikeLee. What a great opportunity to show folks in Washington what our state is about and, prove that we really do have the best food in the country! #utpol https://t.co/HkXN8ZRQmE
Within this funding from @HHSGov is a $520,000 grant to @AUCHUtah that will help 12 health centers across the state improve the use of information technology. This is good news for Utah, especially our state's rural communities. https://t.co/6nl9plTvHT
On Pioneer Day, I think specifically of my pioneer ancestors. My great-great grandfather, Miles Romney, designed the famous spiral staircases in the St. George Tabernacle and my 4x-great grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, advanced Brigham Young‚Äôs route to the Salt Lake Valley. https://t.co/3ImQVp6Z4t
Today, we celebrate and honor the legacy of faith, hard work, and innovation of the courageous pioneers who, fearing no toil nor labor, journeyed west into the Salt Lake Valley. Wishing all Utahns a wonderful Pioneer Day! #alliswell https://t.co/qiIwZ3bN1V

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3
Look at this: GOP pols cowering &amp; pandering to Daily Beast leftists and lying/denying that they don't know who #LauraLoomer is. Crapweasels!
https://t.co/gARlZDsrs1 /2
Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

While impeachment bread and circuses keep the masses distracted and the Keepers of the Gate stifle dissent &amp; debate, #OpenBordersInc gravy train chugs full speed ahead. https://t.co/8gYmhmTt3y
#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.

It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV https://t.co/JaOmTMTBlY
Here is one of the biggest cringe moments, showing your willingness to jettison #1A rights in the interest of #AmericaLast agenda -- and implicitly threatening the kid who asked the question. (Complete video directly from the student.)

Brave Blaze host Jon Miller pushes back against SPLC smears of Stephen Miller, calls out identity politics hypocrisy &amp; points out unassailable facts about immigration &amp; crime. Here comes Media Matters. Next will come the ConInc disavowal hounds. https://t.co/hIUsaPBHsg

@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP

ISIS still remains a threat and as such, the decision to abandon our Kurdish allies was a grave mistake. There are serious questions as to how the U.S. will assure that ISIS prison camps remain secure. https://t.co/f5VPa2ehoP
The Administration confirmed today that Turkey ignored our warning and that the U.S. blinked by withdrawing our troops from northern Syria. This has given us a terrible black eye on the world stage. https://t.co/sZ5MeWX1ts
The administration must explain how the decision to withdraw our troops from Syria was reached. Soon, we‚Äôre holding a @SenateForeign hearing on how this decision impacts U.S. security interests moving forward‚Üí

Heroic effort by Trp. Correa. Always grateful for Utah‚Äôs first responders! https://t.co/2gBsPpsYwI
The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.
‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power
- Russia has assumed control of our previous military positions

The ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô is far from a victory. https://t.co/jjo7nLJSm0

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Tragically, Utah had its first vaping-related death this week.

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Walking away from Syria is not the right answer‚Äînot for Syrians, not for our fellow human beings that are children of the same God, and certainly not for the United States. Moving forward, the U.S. strategy in Syria must address these horrific acts. https://t.co/fbyoXaqi89
In Syria:

Imposing additional severe sanctions on Iran in response to its attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure is an important step in applying pressure on the regime. We must continue to stand with our partners and allies to hold Iran accountable for its egregious actions. https://t.co/6AXOlFRonz
More than 500 vaping-related illnesses and 7 deaths reported by @CDCgov. Nearly 1 in 4 high schoolers vape regularly. @SenJeffMerkley and I are introducing the ENND Act to protect a new generation from nicotine addiction and educate the public about the dangers of vaping. https://t.co/PFUopjbujT
Nearly 25% of high schoolers are vaping regularly. This is unacceptable. @SenJeffMerkley &amp; I are teaming up on legislation that:
‚úîÔ∏èBans e-cigarettes from containing non-tobacco flavors
‚úîÔ∏èRequires cartridges to be tamper-proof
‚úîÔ∏èApplies existing tobacco excise tax to e-cigarettes https://t.co/EfLYRPjPDI
Perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world is an authoritarian China. We must develop a strategy to dissuade China from imposing its authoritarian system on the world, and work with our allies if they continue on this path of threatening our freedoms. https://t.co/DM2Fnmv7d8

Congratulations to my friend Robert O‚ÄôBrien, who the President has appointed to serve as National Security Advisor. As the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, he has doggedly pursued the release of American hostages abroad. He is a man of the highest integrity.

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.
The President made the right call by not directing @USTreasury to index capital gains to inflation, a move that would circumvent Congress, benefit wealthy investors, and add to the debt. My letter to Secretary Mnuchin‚Üí https://t.co/qigZjEmajh

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO This proves my thread's point &amp; underscores pathetic state of "conservative media," now dominated by snotty toddlers who couldn't bother trying to comprehend meta-analyses, case control &amp; cohort studies, let alone VAERS data. Because feelings &gt; facts.

@AmerLifeLeague @RobSchneider @dcexaminer Exactly. Advocates of mandatory jab schemes have gone out of their way to cover up use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacturing.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Protecting national sovereignty begins with protecting family sovereignty--and the freedom to speak in defense of both!
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Informed parents who follow the money &amp; expose truth about #BigPharma 's vaccine racket are defamed &amp; deplatformed by same #BigTech #BigGovernment forces on Left AND Right who target critics of sharia, Antifa &amp; open borders. It's all of a piece. See?

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S
/11
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj
/7
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN
/6
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke
/4
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@RobSchneider Last week, an ignorant snot from the "conservative" @dcexaminer attacked my work challenging HPV/ Gardasil mandates &amp; pro-vaccine orthodoxy from pharma lobbyists &amp; their shills in politics. Pure ad hominem. No facts: /2 https://t.co/kusDhRi4bC

@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in

Left unchecked, today's #pensioncrisis will decimate the retirement future of millions. That's why I joined @JoeCrowleyNY to launch @RetireCoalition and sound the alarm that inaction leaves Americans out to dry. Read our @CNNBusiness piece to learn more: https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0

Adam Schiff will be compelled to testify should the Democrats decide, despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect), to go forward with the Impeachment Hoax. Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment!

Congratulations to my friend Robert O‚ÄôBrien, who the President has appointed to serve as National Security Advisor. As the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, he has doggedly pursued the release of American hostages abroad. He is a man of the highest integrity.
On #ConstitutionDay, we celebrate our country‚Äôs guiding document‚Äîa document that details our common ideals. A government for the people, by the people with three separate, coequal branches. The protection of individual liberties. May we always remember our founding principles. https://t.co/IJCatYjQXd
Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.
The President made the right call by not directing @USTreasury to index capital gains to inflation, a move that would circumvent Congress, benefit wealthy investors, and add to the debt. My letter to Secretary Mnuchin‚Üí https://t.co/qigZjEmajh

At the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, eight athletes carried in the American flag that was flying above the World Trade Center on 9/11. There was not a dry eye in that stadium.

I spent August traveling across our state‚Äîtalking with people in town halls, meeting with local elected officials, and continuing to work on legislation.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The #USMCA creates more balanced, reciprocal trade that‚Äôs better for workers in Utah and across the U.S. Last year, Utah exported $14.4 billion worth of goods to the world.

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious.

While I hope the Administration will act without further delay on its prior proposal to ban flavors that appeal to kids, I will also continue to push for my legislation that bans flavors, ensures that vaping cartridges are tamper-proof, and bans e-cigarettes from schools.
Appreciated @POTUS's efforts to bring together stakeholders &amp; experts to discuss proposals to solve the youth vaping epidemic. Everyone agrees this is a serious problem, but it‚Äôs clear there are differing views about the best way to develop responsible guidelines to protect kids. https://t.co/2xc3y7S0fp
China is exploiting American research institutions and universities to steal U.S. intellectual property, which means American taxpayers are funding China's quest for world dominance.

This evidence does not support @HuaweiUSA‚Äôs claims of a ‚Äúspotless cyber-security track record‚Äù or a sincere desire for dialogue with the U.S. government.
Violating US sanctions on Iran from 2009-2014 and allegedly violating US/UN North Korean sanctions this past summer doesn‚Äôt suggest a sincere interest in cooperating with the United States. https://t.co/8tUhRpXhNe

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp

China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.

Right now, neither party is focused on the debt and deficit. We spent nearly $300 billion last year on the interest of our debt alone! Tackling our debt must be made a priority. Listen to more of my conversation with @BoydMatheson on @KSLnewsradio‚Üí https://t.co/vvMEZdpNR9

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE
The nation has witnessed senseless loss of life from recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, and Gilroy. My statement: https://t.co/3XhcfV3fmK
Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583
As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.
As the current longest-serving member of Utah's delegation, Rob Bishop has dedicated his life to public service. As chairman of @NatResources, Rob has been a vital voice for Utah public lands, leading passage of the largest public lands conservation bill in more than a decade.
Ann and I offer our heartfelt condolences to the family of Norma Matheson. As the First Lady of Utah, she led causes that improved the lives of many in our state. Our prayers are with her family, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.
Kept the #PioneerDay celebrations going with my fellow Utahns at last night‚Äôs Flavors of Utah event, hosted by @SenMikeLee. What a great opportunity to show folks in Washington what our state is about and, prove that we really do have the best food in the country! #utpol https://t.co/HkXN8ZRQmE
Within this funding from @HHSGov is a $520,000 grant to @AUCHUtah that will help 12 health centers across the state improve the use of information technology. This is good news for Utah, especially our state's rural communities. https://t.co/6nl9plTvHT
On Pioneer Day, I think specifically of my pioneer ancestors. My great-great grandfather, Miles Romney, designed the famous spiral staircases in the St. George Tabernacle and my 4x-great grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, advanced Brigham Young‚Äôs route to the Salt Lake Valley. https://t.co/3ImQVp6Z4t

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3
Look at this: GOP pols cowering &amp; pandering to Daily Beast leftists and lying/denying that they don't know who #LauraLoomer is. Crapweasels!
https://t.co/gARlZDsrs1 /2
Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.

It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement.

The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

Always chasing a competitor is not a recipe for success. We can't allow China, a country that refuses to play by the rules, to lead in 5G. U.S. innovators must work with international partners to establish our lead with 5G‚Äîit's of vital importance to our national security. https://t.co/YmX2V8wKYz

The Administration confirmed today that Turkey ignored our warning and that the U.S. blinked by withdrawing our troops from northern Syria. This has given us a terrible black eye on the world stage. https://t.co/sZ5MeWX1ts

Heroic effort by Trp. Correa. Always grateful for Utah‚Äôs first responders! https://t.co/2gBsPpsYwI
The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.
‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

@JDRFAdvocacy @JDRF I will continue working with my @GOPhelp colleagues on finding ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs and reduce out-of-pocket health care costs for American consumers.
It's outrageous that the cost of insulin has tripled over the past 15 years. For the millions of Americans living with diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life and death.

#USMCA is a marked improvement on NAFTA and ratification would be a good thing for American workers and farmers. As a net-export state, Utah‚Äôs agricultural industry would greatly benefit.

Tying the president‚Äôs hands in the midst of a crisis is misguided and dangerous. My #NDAA amendment is not an authorization to use military force against Iran.

https://t.co/GnSatRoZ2o
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Meanwhile, in related news: "Chickenpox vaccine reactivates in two boys, causing rare meningitis more commonly seen in unvaccinated kids." But NEVER question vaccine safety and efficacy cuz that's "conspiracy theory!"

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO This proves my thread's point &amp; underscores pathetic state of "conservative media," now dominated by snotty toddlers who couldn't bother trying to comprehend meta-analyses, case control &amp; cohort studies, let alone VAERS data.

https://t.co/Ec9C02K0wn
@AmerLifeLeague @RobSchneider @dcexaminer Exactly. Advocates of mandatory jab schemes have gone out of their way to cover up use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacturing.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Protecting national sovereignty begins with protecting family sovereignty--and the freedom to speak in defense of both!

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S
/11
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN
/6
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4

SPLC &amp; company are cheering: Cancel culture comes to Boston. Last-minute bureaucratic excuse-making by Bentley University used as pretext to stifle discussion &amp; debate. Stay tuned. We will NOT be silenced. #openbordersinc @sanctuary_no @JessicaV_CIS @TheKuhnerReport https://t.co/3b2emBRwPV
It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

Call me a dumbass. You do you.

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV https://t.co/JaOmTMTBlY
Here is one of the biggest cringe moments, showing your willingness to jettison #1A rights in the interest of #AmericaLast agenda -- and implicitly threatening the kid who asked the question. (Complete video directly from the student.)

Brave Blaze host Jon Miller pushes back against SPLC smears of Stephen Miller, calls out identity politics hypocrisy &amp; points out unassailable facts about immigration &amp; crime. Here comes Media Matters. Next will come the ConInc disavowal hounds. https://t.co/hIUsaPBHsg
The GOP #openbordersinc #AmericaLast caucus is hard at work. Where are all the big DC conservative organizations to oppose this - and especially purported #AmericaFirst campus ‚Äúleaders?‚Äù https://t.co/ars69ndSyC
@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

Mass migration demographics doom American sovereignty. That was message of UCLA speech that got me blacklisted by @yaf - it‚Äôs message of #OpenBordersInc &amp; my CPAC speech.

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in
@CNNBusiness. https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0
Left unchecked, today's #pensioncrisis will decimate the retirement future of millions. That's why I joined @JoeCrowleyNY to launch @RetireCoalition and sound the alarm that inaction leaves Americans out to dry. Read our @CNNBusiness piece to learn more: https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0
Americans need an urgent solution to the multiemployer pension plan crisis that helps us protect millions of miners, truckers, bakers, construction workers, and musicians' hard-earned retirement. Learn more about @RetireCoalition here: https://t.co/865fRRMCYZ #RetirementSecurity

China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Walking away from Syria is not the right answer‚Äînot for Syrians, not for our fellow human beings that are children of the same God, and certainly not for the United States. Moving forward, the U.S. strategy in Syria must address these horrific acts. https://t.co/fbyoXaqi89
In Syria:
- Assad‚Äôs government has conducted chemical attacks on its people
- ISIS is regrouping
- Russia and Iran are increasing their power 

The ‚Äúred line‚Äù seems to be more like a green light. We need a concrete, long-term plan for U.S. involvement in Syria. https://t.co/4dmZqQITwJ
In Syria, we face an Assad regime still in power, the ongoing threat of terrorism, and a humanitarian crisis. Live soon‚Üí Senator Murphy and I will be convening a @SenateForeign hearing on the findings of @USIP‚Äôs bipartisan Syria Study Group. Tune in: https://t.co/Za6q8X8nRX

More than 500 vaping-related illnesses and 7 deaths reported by @CDCgov. Nearly 1 in 4 high schoolers vape regularly. @SenJeffMerkley and I are introducing the ENND Act to protect a new generation from nicotine addiction and educate the public about the dangers of vaping. https://t.co/PFUopjbujT
Nearly 25% of high schoolers are vaping regularly. This is unacceptable. @SenJeffMerkley &amp; I are teaming up on legislation that:
‚úîÔ∏èBans e-cigarettes from containing non-tobacco flavors
‚úîÔ∏èRequires cartridges to be tamper-proof
‚úîÔ∏èApplies existing tobacco excise tax to e-cigarettes https://t.co/EfLYRPjPDI

The protection of individual liberties. May we always remember our founding principles. https://t.co/IJCatYjQXd
Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

I spent August traveling across our state‚Äîtalking with people in town halls, meeting with local elected officials, and continuing to work on legislation.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE

https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious.

The #USMCA creates more balanced, reciprocal trade that‚Äôs better for workers in Utah and across the U.S. Last year, Utah exported $14.4 billion worth of goods to the world.

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE

Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3
Look at this: GOP pols cowering &amp; pandering to Daily Beast leftists and lying/denying that they don't know who #LauraLoomer is. Crapweasels!
https://t.co/gARlZDsrs1 /2
Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c

The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw

This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

Soon, I'll be talking with @kslnewsradio about today's @GOPHELP hearing with the @US_FDA and @CDCgov to dicuss ways to combat the vaping epidemic. Hope you'll tune in: https://t.co/MMS8trls0Q
The rate of vaping-related illness in Utah is 6x the national average. Our country now has more than 5 million young people addicted to nicotine. This is unacceptable. Congress, the @US_FDA, and @CDCgov need to work together to address this epidemic. https://t.co/eibHnJ8eqP
Congress needs to act now to address the vaping epidemic. My legislation:
‚úîÔ∏èBans non-tobacco vaping flavors
‚úîÔ∏èRequires cartridges to be tamper-proof
‚úîÔ∏èApplies excise tax to e-cigarettes
‚úîÔ∏èUses the tax for education
 
Glad @US_FDA and @CDCgov agree this bill would help the public. https://t.co/5nLIz9DQe5
We must protect our young people from the dangers of vaping. Live now‚Üí our @GOPHELP hearing examining the @US_FDA and @CDCgov's response to lung illnesses and rising youth e-cigarette use. https://t.co/evYqtAaE6R

The feeling is more than mutual: We don‚Äôt want Huawei, we don‚Äôt need Huawei, and we shouldn‚Äôt permit Huawei to conduct business here. Huawei is a lackey of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äîa government that spies on its citizens and brutalizes millions of its Uighur minorities. https://t.co/EYn1sNJvRy

Investing retirement savings of military members &amp; federal employees in state-owned firms in China funds their efforts to undermine our security. We must act now to prevent the steering of hardworking Americans' retirement savings into the hands of China. https://t.co/xwEXht15Ef
Our goal with the Climate Solutions Caucus: to craft and advance bipartisan solutions to address climate change. I'm teaming up with @SenatorBraun, @ChrisCoons, @lisamurkowski, @LindseyGrahamSC, @SenatorShaheen, @SenAngusKing, and @SenatorBennet to start this important dialogue. https://t.co/ZRHDl8Ixhd
We also need to consider solutions that will sustain communities that may be impacted by changes in energy technology, and I will continue to meet with folks from our rural and coal mining communities in Utah to hear their perspectives.
Addressing climate change is going to require significant private sector investments and major breakthroughs in innovation and technology. Proud to join the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus to work with my colleagues toward potential solutions for addressing climate change. https://t.co/1DwoB2aAIv
As an oncologist specializing in lung cancer, @US_FDA Commissioner nominee Dr. Hahn understands the urgency of the youth vaping epidemic. He agrees that vape cartridges should be tamper-proof, and I look forward to working with him to solve this public health crisis. https://t.co/Fqwfi31NvR
Sadly, Utah has the nation‚Äôs 5th highest rate of suicide. I applaud @UUtah &amp; the Huntsman family for taking the lead to improve the mental health of Utahns.

There is still much information needed from the @US_FDA on its response to lung illnesses as a result of vaping and the rise in youth e-cigarette use. As a member of @gopHELP, I look forward to meeting with Dr. Hahn to hear about his plan to solve this public health crisis. https://t.co/7atHChF6Q3
Always chasing a competitor is not a recipe for success. We can't allow China, a country that refuses to play by the rules, to lead in 5G. U.S. innovators must work with international partners to establish our lead with 5G‚Äîit's of vital importance to our national security. https://t.co/YmX2V8wKYz
Turkey must be held accountable for its aggressive actions in northern Syria. I applaud the House for coming together to pass these sanctions and look forward to the Senate following suit. Congress must step up and stand up for our Kurdish allies. https://t.co/kr67DuAjF7

Keeping these firefighters in my prayers. https://t.co/wokiwRS6AX
It‚Äôs irresponsible for Congress to keep ignoring the impending collapse of our federal trust funds. The TRUST Act would put in place a process to rescue these important programs that millions of Americans rely on. https://t.co/4XgoGzfdr8

ISIS still remains a threat and as such, the decision to abandon our Kurdish allies was a grave mistake. There are serious questions as to how the U.S. will assure that ISIS prison camps remain secure. https://t.co/f5VPa2ehoP
The Administration confirmed today that Turkey ignored our warning and that the U.S. blinked by withdrawing our troops from northern Syria. This has given us a terrible black eye on the world stage. https://t.co/sZ5MeWX1ts
The administration must explain how the decision to withdraw our troops from Syria was reached. Soon, we‚Äôre holding a @SenateForeign hearing on how this decision impacts U.S. security interests moving forward‚Üí
https://t.co/mexJoUrZpD
Heroic effort by Trp. Correa. Always grateful for Utah‚Äôs first responders! https://t.co/2gBsPpsYwI
The Administration‚Äôs Syria decision has broad strategic implications.
‚òëÔ∏è Iran has been given a stronger hand in Syria.
‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power
- Russia has assumed control of our previous military positions

The ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô is far from a victory. https://t.co/jjo7nLJSm0

Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.

Pleased to see Stephen Dickson confirmed as FAA Administrator. I look forward to working with him on issues that impact Utah, like proposed expansions of smaller community airports like Moab, and larger concerns I have regarding air safety, specifically the Boeing 737 Max. https://t.co/jrVibs6zMe
This is a good step to protect young people across the country from the dangers of e-cigarettes. As a society, we have a collective responsibility to keep these harmful products out of our children's hands and protect them from a lifetime of addiction. https://t.co/OsnPT7u5Ec

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

While impeachment bread and circuses keep the masses distracted and the Keepers of the Gate stifle dissent &amp; debate, #OpenBordersInc gravy train chugs full speed ahead. https://t.co/8gYmhmTt3y
#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.

It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

Here is one of the biggest cringe moments, showing your willingness to jettison #1A rights in the interest of #AmericaLast agenda -- and implicitly threatening the kid who asked the question. (Complete video directly from the student.)

Brave Blaze host Jon Miller pushes back against SPLC smears of Stephen Miller, calls out identity politics hypocrisy &amp; points out unassailable facts about immigration &amp; crime. Here comes Media Matters. Next will come the ConInc disavowal hounds. https://t.co/hIUsaPBHsg

@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

Mass migration demographics doom American sovereignty. That was message of UCLA speech that got me blacklisted by @yaf - it‚Äôs message of #OpenBordersInc &amp; my CPAC speech.

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in

Left unchecked, today's #pensioncrisis will decimate the retirement future of millions. That's why I joined @JoeCrowleyNY to launch @RetireCoalition and sound the alarm that inaction leaves Americans out to dry. Read our @CNNBusiness piece to learn more: https://t.co/rccbz5jXJ0

‚òëÔ∏è Russia‚Äôs influence in the Middle East has been greatly enhanced.
‚òëÔ∏è Assad is consolidating power.
 
This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/jb10DAKy5y
What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles‚Äîthat the United States stands with our allies. https://t.co/CrICNP58kx
Since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from Syria:
- the Kurds have suffered loss of life and property
- Assad has consolidated his power
- Russia has assumed control of our previous military positions

The ‚Äòceasefire‚Äô is far from a victory. https://t.co/jjo7nLJSm0
Live now‚Üí I‚Äôm on the Senate Floor discussing the latest development out of Syria. https://t.co/hPaLsw11hn
Pleased to see Barbara Barrett overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate to serve as @SecAFOfficial. I look forward to working with Secretary Barrett to keep efforts to modernize our nuclear deterrent at Utah's @HAFB on track. https://t.co/ZrxbI5Vp2g
Iran‚Äôs power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends, the Kurds, in Syria. Because the U.S. is abandoning its position in Syria, Assad is becoming stronger, and Iran is smiling ear to ear. This is a foreign policy disaster. https://t.co/Ah1SMYlC7t
It‚Äôs astonishing that the Administration‚Äôs top Iran expert does not believe Turkey‚Äôs attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran. Kurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran! https://t.co/R0d4Qad7HQ
.@MeritMedical is a Utah success story. Visited it‚Äôs South Jordan headquarters to discuss with workers ways to sustain economic growth and job creation, as well as the impact of the medical device tax. Impressed by the services Merit provides its employees. https://t.co/lVKrftnsI2
Vaping has nearly doubled among young people in Utah over the last five years. Appreciate the local officials and health experts who updated me on their anti-vaping efforts in Utah, and I look forward to continuing our work to keep children from getting hooked on these products. https://t.co/hJTOYQtBmb
Tragically, Utah had its first vaping-related death this week. Sitting down with health experts from @UtahDepOfHealth, @UofUHealth, @AmericanCancer, and more at @PrimaryChildren in Salt Lake City to discuss anti-vaping efforts in Utah and potential action at the federal level. https://t.co/nNKGq7uaRh
Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp
100 years ago today, Utah ratified the 19th Amendment. Women across our state, however, had been granted voting rights nearly 25 years earlier. Excited for the statue of Utah suffragist Martha Hughes Cannon to be brought to the @USCapitol next year. https://t.co/0Xvayzrg9g
China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.
After 70 years in power, the Chinese Communist Party continues a relentless campaign of brutal repression and censorship. An authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world. https://t.co/WxwSDfL2b9

Walking away from Syria is not the right answer‚Äînot for Syrians, not for our fellow human beings that are children of the same God, and certainly not for the United States. Moving forward, the U.S. strategy in Syria must address these horrific acts. https://t.co/fbyoXaqi89
In Syria:
- Assad‚Äôs government has conducted chemical attacks on its people
- ISIS is regrouping

Imposing additional severe sanctions on Iran in response to its attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure is an important step in applying pressure on the regime. We must continue to stand with our partners and allies to hold Iran accountable for its egregious actions. https://t.co/6AXOlFRonz
More than 500 vaping-related illnesses and 7 deaths reported by @CDCgov. Nearly 1 in 4 high schoolers vape regularly. @SenJeffMerkley and I are introducing the ENND Act to protect a new generation from nicotine addiction and educate the public about the dangers of vaping. https://t.co/PFUopjbujT
Nearly 25% of high schoolers are vaping regularly. This is unacceptable. @SenJeffMerkley &amp; I are teaming up on legislation that:
‚úîÔ∏èBans e-cigarettes from containing non-tobacco flavors
‚úîÔ∏èRequires cartridges to be tamper-proof
‚úîÔ∏èApplies existing tobacco excise tax to e-cigarettes https://t.co/EfLYRPjPDI
Perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world is an authoritarian China. We must develop a strategy to dissuade China from imposing its authoritarian system on the world, and work with our allies if they continue on this path of threatening our freedoms. https://t.co/DM2Fnmv7d8

Congratulations to my friend Robert O‚ÄôBrien, who the President has appointed to serve as National Security Advisor. As the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, he has doggedly pursued the release of American hostages abroad. He is a man of the highest integrity.
On #ConstitutionDay, we celebrate our country‚Äôs guiding document‚Äîa document that details our common ideals. A government for the people, by the people with three separate, coequal branches. The protection of individual liberties. May we always remember our founding principles. https://t.co/IJCatYjQXd
Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran‚Äôs attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.
The President made the right call by not directing @USTreasury to index capital gains to inflation, a move that would circumvent Congress, benefit wealthy investors, and add to the debt. My letter to Secretary Mnuchin‚Üí https://t.co/qigZjEmajh

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*

I applaud the administration for taking swift action to eliminate flavored e-cigarettes that are clearly intended to deceive our nation‚Äôs young people. Eliminating flavors is a good first step.

At the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, eight athletes carried in the American flag that was flying above the World Trade Center on 9/11. There was not a dry eye in that stadium.

I spent August traveling across our state‚Äîtalking with people in town halls, meeting with local elected officials, and continuing to work on legislation.

Congress will have an opportunity to restore this funding in the next budget cycle. I will work with @SenMikeLee and the other members of our delegation to fight for funding for these projects, which are essential to Utah‚Äôs service members and our national security strategy.
Today, the Administration announced that funding for two projects crucial to military readiness at Utah‚Äôs @HAFB will be diverted as a result of the Feb. 2019 emergency declaration. The Executive Branch should use the appropriate channels, not divert already appropriated funding.
Opioid addiction is not just a national epidemic‚Äîwe‚Äôre losing hundreds and hundreds of Utahns each year to opioid overdoses. Pleased to see our state awarded nearly $8 million by @HHSgov to aid in Utah‚Äôs ongoing prevention, treatment, and recovery services. https://t.co/fnTcOMF4LR

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious.

Everyone agrees this is a serious problem, but it‚Äôs clear there are differing views about the best way to develop responsible guidelines to protect kids. https://t.co/2xc3y7S0fp
China is exploiting American research institutions and universities to steal U.S. intellectual property, which means American taxpayers are funding China's quest for world dominance.

This evidence does not support @HuaweiUSA‚Äôs claims of a ‚Äúspotless cyber-security track record‚Äù or a sincere desire for dialogue with the U.S. government.
Violating US sanctions on Iran from 2009-2014 and allegedly violating US/UN North Korean sanctions this past summer doesn‚Äôt suggest a sincere interest in cooperating with the United States. https://t.co/8tUhRpXhNe
Spotless? Public reporting suggests otherwise: https://t.co/Xekk9Dee18 https://t.co/xWLpkcMpP4
Some evidence:
- Alleged IP theft from U.S. companies like T Mobile and Cisco

Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It‚Äôs a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President‚Äôs decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.
The US must not stand by in the face of massive human rights violations. The administration is right to take action against organizations that assist the Chinese Communist Party in creating a police state in Xinjiang Province and interning millions of Uighurs &amp; other minorities. https://t.co/ZjIg9jis2j
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT‚Üí https://t.co/LF4TkowJZC
This President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.
The President‚Äôs decision to abandon our Kurd allies in the face of an assault by Turkey is a betrayal. It says that America is an unreliable ally; it facilitates ISIS resurgence; and it presages another humanitarian disaster. https://t.co/Tu8ARa8Pmp

China‚Äôs grave human rights abuses, particularly the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong and the internment of the Uighur people, underscore the urgency for the U.S. to partner with our friends and allies on a comprehensive strategy to address the rising China threat.

Great to sit down with my friend @BoydMatheson for @KSLnewsradio today discussing conservatism, ways to tackle the debt &amp; deficit, and other news of the day. Thanks for having me on, Boyd! https://t.co/vL773BYNZj
Right now, neither party is focused on the debt and deficit. We spent nearly $300 billion last year on the interest of our debt alone! Tackling our debt must be made a priority. Listen to more of my conversation with @BoydMatheson on @KSLnewsradio‚Üí https://t.co/vvMEZdpNR9

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom‚Äôs precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China‚Äôs relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.
Our nation‚Äôs healthcare system is in need of transparency, from drug pricing to the cost of procedures. However, reducing healthcare costs for Americans will require a multi-pronged approach. Proud of @UUtah for doing its part to help tackle this problem. https://t.co/2HUToei1cE
The nation has witnessed senseless loss of life from recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, and Gilroy. My statement: https://t.co/3XhcfV3fmK
Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God‚Äôs children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I‚Äôm opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children &amp; grandchildren from a future debt crisis. https://t.co/Wu2JgmX583
As a senior member on @HASCRepublicans, he has championed Utah interests in our national defense and led the fight to save @HAFB when it was threatened with closure. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob to get things done for Utah before he begins a new chapter.
As the current longest-serving member of Utah's delegation, Rob Bishop has dedicated his life to public service. As chairman of @NatResources, Rob has been a vital voice for Utah public lands, leading passage of the largest public lands conservation bill in more than a decade.

On Pioneer Day, I think specifically of my pioneer ancestors. My great-great grandfather, Miles Romney, designed the famous spiral staircases in the St. George Tabernacle and my 4x-great grandfather, Parley P. Pratt, advanced Brigham Young‚Äôs route to the Salt Lake Valley. https://t.co/3ImQVp6Z4t

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10
@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke

@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder.

@Twitter @Ilhan Good point by @DrPaulGosar striking back at LL's Dem incumbent opponent @RepLoisFrankel  - who Laura outraised last quarter:
https://t.co/oCtsZoHXNv /6
@Twitter @Ilhan Blowhards of #ConInc get on TV &amp; pay lip service to fighting CAIR/jihad-coddlers&amp;censors. Did they support Laura's lawsuit against CAIR thugs who collaborate w/Silicon Valley to stifle critics? NO! Now CAIR's tool who got LL banned from Twitter gloats. /5
https://t.co/Yd3r4PuYPs
@Twitter @Ilhan Look at how meaningless the slurs are. This moron calls anti-sharia, pro-Israel Laura "Islamophobic" &amp; "antisemitic." Both elite left &amp; right dismiss her as "conspiracy theorist" to shut her down...while both sides preen about supporting free speech. /4
https://t.co/T6MJxnhDo6
Today is one-year anniversary of Laura's ban by @twitter for exposing @Ilhan 's allegiance to radical Islam &amp; anti-Semitism. Who spoke up for her? Where was #ConInc ? Now they all surf anti-Omar wave while mocking/shunning LL. Because *virtue signal!*
https://t.co/m5aDKp02PA /3
Look at this: GOP pols cowering &amp; pandering to Daily Beast leftists and lying/denying that they don't know who #LauraLoomer is. Crapweasels!
https://t.co/gARlZDsrs1 /2
Thread: #ConInc establishment is made up of cowards. #LauraLoomer has battled jihadist tools, #SiliconValleySharia &amp; exposed Dem anti-America squad (Omar/Tlaib) before anyone was paying attention. The same Swamp people attacking me as "anti-Semite" attack me for supporting LL! /1

While impeachment bread and circuses keep the masses distracted and the Keepers of the Gate stifle dissent &amp; debate, #OpenBordersInc gravy train chugs full speed ahead. https://t.co/8gYmhmTt3y
#OpenBordersInc left &amp; right don't want to debate mass migration. They just want to demagogue--while joining right now to push expanded guestworker pipelines (SB386/HR1044), agribiz amnesties (HR4916) &amp; massive DREAMer work permits (HR6). Disgrace.

It's #ConInc 's fave lying smear merchant, credentialed by CPAC &amp; echoed by TPUSA leaders. This cretin slimed #LauraLoomer, @mrandyngo , @cernovich , Eoin Lenihan &amp; many others. Watch who parrots him.  Tells you everything. Question: Is @CPAC going to welcome him again in 2020? https://t.co/uXgrItmXag
You're an arrogant, lazy, SPLC-regurgitating smear merchant. I've actually talked to #AmericaFirst kids from CSU Fort Collins, ASU, Kansas State, UCLA &amp; Univ of WA challenging #OpenBordersInc - they are not racist &amp; they are not trolls. You smear to deflect &amp; protect #ConInc https://t.co/6i0XeekL1c
I vehemently oppose the jihadist enablers who are driving the BDS movement. 

I also oppose overly broad, unconstitutional anti-BDS laws that infringe on the First Amendment and criminalize opinion.

@nedryun Thank you @nedryun !
The ConInc rule is that if the New York Times &amp; LA Times report the truth about #openbordersinc demographic disaster, it's journalism.

If #AmericaFirst advocates speak it, it's "racism" &amp; "white nationalism." https://t.co/uAMSlrc5cC
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport @NickJFuentes https://t.co/YzaLBvv03N
Another piece of SPLC-inspired garbage by WashExaminer twit who hurls smears, attacks me for being "single-issue" on immigration (then attacks my vaccine views), &amp; links to her smear job on my friends at @theamgreatness - This is the state of Con journalism while America burns. https://t.co/tp3QhwK1a0
@WRKO680 @TheKuhnerReport For the record, here is @NickJFuentes responding to the accusations against him &amp; the organizations/individuals smearing us both to squash speech. Straight out of the SPLC playbook. Starts at 41 mins:
https://t.co/imiHlFFUrT
Yes, good idea! As I said in the hour long interview, many lies have been spread about me, @NickJFuentes &amp; all the young students who challenged #openbordersinc on college campuses the past three weeks. https://t.co/JYnJOWKKBo

Skeered. YAF calls cops on conservative media activist @KaitMarieox for asking questions.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGW
Here is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODV
You failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZ
FYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqw
I‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS
@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!
This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

The Detroit Carpenters‚Äô Pension Trust Fund is one of the latest pension plans making the case to cut benefits by as much as 26% to avoid insolvency. The crisis is here, which is why @RetireCoalition is sending the message: Americans need help now. https://t.co/TQAnHvVWTP
.@JoeCrowleyNY and I "know all too well when something doesn't get fixed in D.C., it can end up hurting people back home. When it comes to the multiemployer pension plan crisis, the effects are already real." To learn more, read our piece in
