I believe we should create a new federal agency that has the power to review and set drug prices—offering relief to the millions who struggle to afford their medication. We must lower the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs in this country.
Our Democratic candidate must have an authentic connection within the Black community and inspire and generate record turnout from Black voters—that's how we beat Donald Trump and win back the Senate. https://t.co/jd0CosDTzN
Climate change is not some distant threat—it’s happening now and we need to act. My plan to address this crisis includes building a 100% carbon-neutral economy by 2045 while creating millions of good-paying jobs: https://t.co/xk15EskiLx
We will only succeed in this race if, in the words of one Nevada Democrat @senatorreid—we remember where we come from and why we’re here. Together, we will rise. https://t.co/VEhHwF9NTm
Every single day, more and more lives are lost to the opioid crisis. It's time for action. We can start by holding pharmaceutical companies responsible for their role in flooding these drugs into our communities.
No one should be harassed or fired from a job because of their hairstyle—yet Black people often experience discrimination for wearing their natural hair. This must end, and my new legislation with @CedricRichmond will do it. https://t.co/O7XQcipTB3
The only way we're going to get our poll numbers up is if we reach more voters—that's why we're trying to fund TV ads. Help us buy some airtime so we can lock in our spot on the December debate stage: https://t.co/bMgDOZtBcV
The stronger the coalition, the greater the victory. The more inclusive the coalition, the greater the victory. This is how we win. https://t.co/VmDRzSjEN7

We are less than 2 months away from the Iowa Caucuses. Now is our time to break through. Let's seize this moment—chip in now to support our campaign: https://t.co/RYDvR4r6Y1
This is wrong and cruel. We need to expand SNAP so that more American families don’t go hungry—that’s exactly what I’ll fight for as president: https://t.co/cuCUtm4ftI https://t.co/YPNQT5xLSQ
Grateful for everyone who came together today for our town hall in Harlan, Iowa to meet with @JDScholten and me to talk about how we can bring prosperity &amp; opportunity to rural America—and my new plan to get it done as president: https://t.co/nMl1Nd6Mkd https://t.co/bhfIxmcWhy
Chip in now so we can get this on TV before the DNC debate! https://t.co/WiejmdwAuA
I highly recommend watching my friend @Ava's film, 13th, to learn more about the criminalization of Black people in the United States. It's available on Netflix and examines how we got here. https://t.co/gMoWbmIhlI
December 6th marks 154 years since the 13th Amendment was ratified, abolishing slavery. Yet, today in 2019 the United States has more African American men under criminal supervision than all the slaves back in the 1850s.
Today, I'm unveiling a plan to create new pathways to opportunity and prosperity in rural America—because no one should have to leave their home to build a future in this country. Read it here: https://t.co/BzelymkkDf
@JDScholten Good morning, JD! Looking forward to it—can’t wait to “catch” up!
A Democratic debate with more self-funding billionaires than candidates of color would be a disservice to our party. Donate now so we can start running TV ads and qualify for the next debate: https://t.co/bBtU9EGjtB
Every worker in our country deserves fair compensation. Thank you @SEIU1984 for leading the charge to make sure that Granite Staters aren't shortchanged by a contract which doesn't pay fair wages. I stand with you and the NH State Employees you are fighting for. #UnionsForAll
I’m going to be blunt: if you want me in this race, now is the time to voice your support for my campaign. When pollsters call—choose us. Help us reach the DNC poll requirements for the December debate. We need you now more than ever. https://t.co/GGIUNLDC5J
Happy to see the Senate pass the #FUTUREAct to provide critical funding for HBCUs. When I am president, we're going to make a historic $100 billion investment into HBCUs and MSIs to restore justice and empower Black and Brown communities all across America. https://t.co/UxW4EuLdpI
@rosemarierung Thank you, Representative! So grateful to have you on this team.
Our country was in the midst of a moral moment when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat, sparking the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which began #OTD in 1955. She and her fellow activists inspired millions with their grit, reminding us to never surrender our work for justice. https://t.co/lSLleGxdm5
Love, empathy, and compassion are not contrary to fighting the good fight. No, they are the necessary ingredients we need to defeat Donald Trump.

You want to bring a fight—you bring people together. https://t.co/dguNTYJS6o
A lot of folks run for president because they want to change the country. Very few of them actually do. @KamalaHarris did. https://t.co/K9eQJXtVMq
Iowa, do not let anyone else decide this for you.

Our accomplishments have always come from the grassroots. Our party has always been strongest when we as Democrats come together, not tearing each other down, but lifting one another up.
Beating Donald Trump is the floor, not the ceiling. It gets us out of the valley—it does not get us to the mountaintop.
How will calling on a more courageous empathy beat Donald Trump? It’s the *only* way we will win.

You want to bring a fight, you bring people together.
This must be the season where we again recognize the peril in our nation stems from our division.
The blessings we enjoy were paid for by the struggles of others—activists and fellow Americans who joined together in a conspiracy of love.
The more diverse the coalition, the more justice we’re able to attain.
This is not just about an individual candidate—it’s about the diverse coalition that is necessary to beat Donald Trump. https://t.co/RXktRta6wn
“Kamala had a campaign where little girls and boys and people all around the country looked up and said 'that could be me.'” —Cory Booker
We must beat Trump—and to do that, we need to unite our party, excite &amp; engage Black voters &amp; rebuild the coalition that we need to defeat him.
Join me live in Des Moines to hear why I believe I’m the best candidate to take on these &amp; other challenges: https://t.co/nLRdpr2Gs3
The evidence presented before the House was both deeply upsetting and damning. Donald Trump took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution—and he has abdicated that responsibility. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for handling this process with the seriousness it demands.
We're running out of time to qualify for the December debate. I won't be on that stage unless we meet the DNC's polling threshold. I need your help right now to fund our ads so we can reach more voters and boost our poll numbers. Chip in today: https://t.co/wj5OvWXZB8
@cmclymer Charlotte, I'm so sorry this happened to you. I believe you, I see you, I love you. Thank you for your courage.
#OTD in 1967 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. announced the Poor People’s Campaign—a new march on Washington bringing together Americans to demand better education, fair wages, and an overall higher quality of life. Today, that struggle continues—it’s on us to finish the fight.
There are more billionaires than Black people who’ve made the December debate stage—that’s a problem. https://t.co/W9zQcAP9iv
There are more billionaires than Black people who’ve made the December debate stage—that’s a problem. https://t.co/yL1HbFt2BD
@VanSAV2019, congratulations on your big win tonight! Can't wait to see everything you do for the city of Savannah.
We started with one of the most diverse fields in our history. It's a damn shame that the only African American woman in this race is no longer in it, and we're spiraling toward a debate stage without a single person of color. https://t.co/rKbVcuDZZS
Minority-serving institutions play a central role in empowering minority communities &amp; creating opportunity. That’s why my new plan ensures these critical MSIs are well-funded, affordable, and continue to deliver opportunity for Black &amp; Brown Americans. https://t.co/j7kpKmGRjV
My dear friend @KamalaHarris is a trailblazer. I've loved serving with her in the Senate and every moment we've run into one another on the trail. Her campaign broke barriers and did it with joy. Love you, sister. https://t.co/HzLXw88NrM

@GarySanchez12 @JCastleWrites Thank you for your generosity and kind words... the truth is the older I get the better I was!
As the son of two proud HBCU grads (@FISK1866 and @NCCU!), I'm proud to announce that today my campaign is proposing the boldest-ever plan to invest in HBCUs: https://t.co/j7kpKmGRjV
We need a nominee who can turn out voters in places like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee and inspire Americans all across this country. https://t.co/Dx4CiO8UFY

It's simple: If you sustain an injury playing a sport on behalf of a college or university, you shouldn’t be left to cover the medical expenses on your own. That doesn’t happen now, but it will when I’m president: https://t.co/RD2H5yzHhs
Climate change must be the lens through which we view everything—it’s the existential threat of our lifetime. https://t.co/Wsl1pmEkIw
It's important to beat Donald Trump, but the bigger issue is confronting our history and present to create the safe, inclusive country we all want to live in. https://t.co/Vv8QocpW2A
Nearly 40 million are living with HIV around the world with nearly 2 million more diagnosed every year. On #WorldAIDSDay we remember those we’ve lost to this disease, recommit to ending the HIV epidemic, &amp; continue to work together toward a future without stigma &amp; discrimination.
It's a national disgrace that millions of our children grow up in poverty. We have a moral imperative to act. I have a plan that would put us on the pathway to ending child poverty in America. https://t.co/kGMRBGlZ4n
We know we need to accelerate the end of fossil fuels to avert climate catastrophe—and that’s what my plan calls for: https://t.co/xk15EskiLx
People ask whether love can beat Trump, but if you look at our collective history, love is the *only* way we can win. From Seneca Falls to Selma and Stonewall, we've beaten hate and demagogues before—when we've come together.

Watch and share my campaign’s newest ad here: https://t.co/GXBglHyEjc
Tune in! https://t.co/KQuorveicd
Our country’s broken drug laws don’t make us safer—they divert resources from fighting violent crime and unfairly hurt low-income communities and communities of color.
People ask how I believe we can come together to address our common pain—well, I know we can because we have before. #OTD in 1993 we passed the bipartisan Brady Bill mandating background checks &amp; waiting period on handgun buyers. It’s saved countless lives. We can do it again.
Every American deserves the right to drink clean water and breathe clean air.
Everywhere I go, I let people know: if we win, I’ll be asking for more from you. Not to put up with more injustice, but to engage more—to join, to march, to fight. Our country doesn’t need a savior—it needs us to show up and do the work. https://t.co/Sk8DCgoFp3
If you’re injured as an athlete playing for your college or university, then your school should cover your medical expenses while under treatment. That's not the case today. We need to change this: https://t.co/RD2H5yzHhs
The right to vote is one of the most sacred rights in a democratic society. We can protect and expand access to the ballot box by:

✅ Restoring the Voting Rights Act
✅ Making Election Day a national holiday
✅ Implementing universal automatic voter registration
Happy Thanksgiving! Wishing everyone a wonderful day of gratitude, love, family, friends &amp; food. As we give thanks, let’s also live up to the words of JFK: "As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them."
This is heartbreaking. Jesus Martinez Manon has lived in the US, raised his family here for the last 30 years, and has no criminal record. Our nation needs humane immigration policies, not more examples of families being needlessly torn apart. https://t.co/7bsWVlKDZT

There is a serious housing affordability crisis in this country. We need to create a Renters Credit to cap rental costs, expand the supply of affordable housing, and fight back against predatory practices in the housing market.

To reduce firearm suicide, we have to get guns out of the hands of those who have shown signs of wanting to hurt themselves or others. https://t.co/sb6iGluDdd
There are so many reasons why the death penalty is wrong—and this is one of them. These are innocent lives ruined because of a racist and badly broken criminal justice system. There must be accountability and justice for these victims. https://t.co/uUDVPSovPx

We need a president who takes environmental justice seriously.
We should be putting cash back in the pockets of working families who are struggling to get ahead. By dramatically expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, my proposed Rise Credit would lower taxes for millions of Americans. https://t.co/yh7loojMNY
Grateful for @UNITEHERE fighting for airline workers currently on strike. All workers deserve fair pay and meaningful benefits. It's why I introduced legislation to crack down on labor law violations in the airline industry—as president I'll fight for this &amp; more for workers. https://t.co/JvZU7wClMF
Now THIS is what I’m talking about when I talk about courageous empathy. Pinky, you already know I’m a fan of your burgers, but I’m an even bigger fan of your spirit. Thank you for your generosity and your investment in our country’s collective future. https://t.co/EjAUZphtSA
@wawagatheru Congratulations, Wawa! You inspire.
Don't talk to me about legalizing marijuana if you're not also talking about investing in the communities that have been ravaged by the failed War on Drugs. The end we seek is not just legalization—it's justice.
We should be investing in our young people and empowering them with the tools to achieve their dreams—starting on the day they're born. My proposal to create Baby Bonds would virtually eliminate the racial wealth gap that exists in our country. https://t.co/MySJoyAAuR
@mollycbiron Thank you, Molly, for all your hard work and for your wonderful introduction Saturday!

5 years ago, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was gunned down by a cop who saw this child as a man—yet he would still be a child today. Even in death, Tamir's innocence was stolen.

We need racial bias training at all levels of law enforcement &amp; do more to protect our Black children.
@TheSobaika @davejorgenson @washingtonpost I just wasted 5 mins watching that over and over and over. The only thing better is if you posted a picture of me with hair.
Every single day that Congress doesn't act to pass sensible gun safety laws is another day that innocent lives are lost. It is way past time to ban weapons of war from our streets.
