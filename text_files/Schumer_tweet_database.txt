We owe all our veterans a debt of gratitude today and every day. https://t.co/XVRItRBxIU
Steven Menashi played a leading role in designing an illegal effort to deny debt relief to thousands of students swindled by for-profit colleges

That fact that President Trump is rewarding him with a lifetime appointment to the federal bench is appalling

https://t.co/XRPQ7j93xp
To our veterans and their families:

America will always be grateful for your service and your sacrifice. We will keep fighting for you.

#VeteransDay
Peter King stood head &amp; shoulders above everyone else

He’s been principled &amp; never let others push him away from his principles

He’s fiercely loved America, Long Island, and his Irish heritage and left a lasting mark on all 3

I will miss him in Congress &amp; value his friendship https://t.co/GSXizZ2c5D
The Marines were formed 244 years ago today. We could not be prouder of everyone who wears the @USMC uniform and serves our country so bravely.
You don’t have to hear it from me.

This is what @AlexHonnold, @SashaDiGiulian, @TommyCaldwell1, and the @AccessFund have to say about how preserving our environment and public lands can help our economy. https://t.co/k8uKMUg9U9
We must fight to preserve wild places for future generations

From Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
To the Gunks in New York
To Kentucky's Red River Gorge

Here's @TommyCaldwell1, @AlexHonnold, &amp; @SashaDiGiulian on @ProtectWinters and our environment &amp; public lands https://t.co/kRqxWT5DFm
It is unacceptable that President Trump pulled us out of the Paris climate agreement. Period.

Listen to @SashaDiGiulian, @TommyCaldwell1, and @AlexHonnold talk with me about the fight to preserve our climate for future generations. https://t.co/VI3zjI0X5v
With President Trump pulling America out of the Paris climate agreement this week:

I'm sharing a conversation I had with @AlexHonnold, @SashaDiGiulian, and @TommyCaldwell1 about their stories, the impacts of climate change they’ve seen, and why they fight for our environment. https://t.co/Ng2K6tdXsV
Steven Menashi concocted a plan to illegally use the private Social Security data of defrauded student borrowers to deny them debt forgiveness after they were preyed upon by for-profit schools

This is someone Pres. Trump wants us to make a federal judge?

https://t.co/XRPQ7j93xp
President Trump shouldn’t be giving in to China unless we get something big in return.

https://t.co/8hMAGshipa
President Trump’s disturbing pattern of putting partisan politics over our national interests is as alarming as it is consistent.

His administration must reverse course on their reckless decision to terminate TPS.

https://t.co/PWTd5QO2c8
A judge is supposed to uphold and interpret the law, have a reverence for the law.

Not someone who schemes to break it.

Steven Menashi’s nomination is an embarrassment and an insult to millions of hardworking Americans saddled by student debt.

https://t.co/XRPQ7j93xp
In ignoring numerous, emphatic warnings from State Department officials:

President Trump put at risk the safety and wellbeing of nearly 400,000 TPS beneficiaries and their U.S.-citizen children and strengthened transnational gangs such as MS-13.

https://t.co/PWTd5QO2c8
Pres. Trump:

The House passed a bipartisan, universal background checks bill 250 days ago this week

But there are indications you reversed your support for gun safety legislation

So Sen. McConnell followed your example and refused to vote on the bill

https://t.co/1JYN19DdzS
This damning investigation by @SenatorMenendez and his staff shows that in a political mad dash to punish immigrants no matter the cost:

President Trump and his administration defied the guidance of career officials and endangered our national security.

https://t.co/PWTd5QO2c8
Horace Mann once said: ‘Education—beyond all other devices of human origin—is the great equalizer’

For education
For the American dream
We must pass the #FUTUREAct to renew critical funding for minority-serving institutions

It can't wait in Sen. McConnell legislative graveyard! https://t.co/npI8ab1nLI
I just demanded we pass a bill making Pres. Trump tell us his plan for the enduring defeat of ISIS

After green-lighting Erdogan's invasion of Syria that led to an ISIS jailbreak, Pres. Trump is rolling out the White House welcome mat for him!

But @SenRickScott blocked the bill https://t.co/AanA8baSx6
Pres. Trump will welcome Erdogan to the White House

Frankly, it's confounding he's welcoming an autocrat whose invasion of northern Syria killed &amp; displaced the Kurds, our partners in the fight against ISIS

We still don't know Trump’s plan to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS! https://t.co/OyhioxHWsa
Let me repeat:

Steven Menashi concocted a plan to illegally use the private Social Security data of defrauded student borrowers to deny them debt forgiveness after they were preyed upon by for-profit schools

His nomination to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is an embarrassment https://t.co/lna3NuhNjE
We are going down a dangerous road when Senators are refusing to stand up for our nation’s laws.
 
Senate Republicans even went so far as to block a resolution reaffirming our support for whistleblower protection laws. https://t.co/CNDYAq6iYx
President Trump:

You’re rolling out the White House welcome mat for Erdogan, an autocrat whose actions threaten our allies &amp; partners.

You still haven’t told us your plan to contain ISIS prisoners who escaped after Erdogan’s invasion of northern Syria!

https://t.co/yQtuK3DsGD
I just took to the Senate floor with Senator @MazieHirono to demand we pass a resolution to defend whistleblowers.

Because to do otherwise would send a chilling message to future patriots that they risk exposure, retaliation, and retribution.

But Senator @RandPaul blocked it. https://t.co/xWNPNoWcNu
The nomination of these hard-right judges, hurting average Americans,

Over and over and over again,

Finding every excuse to side with the rich and powerful over working families,

This is what President Trump and Senate Republicans call an accomplishment? https://t.co/yM3WYragdO
Immigrants have made America what it is today.

We don’t build walls.

We don’t shut our gates.

As the Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments on President Trump's baseless decision to end DACA, I’m so proud to stand with the Dreamers. #HomeIsHere
Senator McConnell:

Why are you just letting the #FUTUREAct sit in your legislative graveyard?

The bipartisan bill will renew critical funding for HBCUs and minority-serving institutions.

It passed the House 50 days ago! It’s time to vote. Now. https://t.co/DRbIDtNKjA
Let me repeat this: 
 
Whistleblowers who stand up for the Constitution should NOT be targeted by President @realDonaldTrump or powerful members of the legislative branch. https://t.co/E2qurKnGIY
When it comes to judicial nominees, President Trump and Senate Republicans should be ashamed of their record.
 
The President has nominated—and Senate Republicans have approved—the most unqualified and radical nominees in my time in this body. https://t.co/BZ1a5FU0VI
It’s time to invest in cutting-edge technologies from AI, to quantum computing, to robotics, to 5G.

This is about the future of America.

This should not be a partisan issue.

This should be of the same importance as putting a man on the moon.

https://t.co/IFhLuUSvYl
Leader McConnell has not moved even one gun safety bill to the floor.

And just like on so many other issues, President Trump would rather do nothing to help the American people than upset special interests like the NRA.

https://t.co/SEH5DV4BnW
Senate Republicans need to remember why they came to the Senate in the first place, to work for the American people.

This year, Senate Republicans have spent more time twisting themselves into pretzels trying to defend President Trump’s behavior than actually legislating. https://t.co/dzQxbxS2OI
Every day that @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the @SenateGOP fail to allow votes on bipartisan bills, they are hurting working people

And right now, we’re also seeing how Pres. Trump’s obsession with protecting his own political interests is hurting working people across the country https://t.co/Mdh6H5phBy
The Trump Administration formally sent notice to the U.N. that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2020.

Future generations will look back on this decision as a dramatic step backward in the fight to address the climate crisis. https://t.co/8N9VUuET21
How many lives will it take before President @realDonaldTrump and Senate Republicans come to their senses and work with us to finally do something about the epidemic of gun violence in America? https://t.co/S6LSNF9T27
President Trump held a political rally in Kentucky where Senator Paul urged the media to disclose the identity of a federal whistleblower.
 
This is wrong.
 
We have federal whistleblower laws designed to protect the identity and safety of patriotic Americans who come forward. https://t.co/dJimzPo2vb

Thank you to the FBI for preventing what could have been another tragedy at a synagogue in America.

Senate Democrats continue to stand with the vast majority of Americans who are demanding their elected officials stop kowtowing to corporate polluters and take action to address the mounting threat posed by climate change.

https://t.co/jIOZjL5R2y
Future generations will look back on President Trump’s decision as a dramatic step backward in the fight to address the climate crisis that will hurt our planet, our economy, and our national security for decades to come.

In the long list of pitiful and dangerous policy decisions @realDonaldTrump has made as president, today’s announcement ranks as one of the worst.

The U.S. government investigation into TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company—if true—is welcome news.

That’s funny, @SenateMajLdr McConnell!

Gun safety,
Violence against women,
And more are just sitting in your legislative graveyard?

Instead, you’re just trying to set up a vote on four more extreme judges next week. https://t.co/oYpX0KYBB2
So proud of @PatrickCorbin46 for getting a big curly W for the @Nationals. He’s from Syracuse!

I might be a @Yankees fan, but my heart swelled with pride when I saw this New Yorker on the mound in Game 7.
A bill meant to provide resources for our troops &amp; their families steals money from them for Pres. Trump's border wall.

Of course, @SenateGOP has resorted to bogus attacks, accusing Democrats of delaying a pay raise for our troops even though it's safe.

https://t.co/4nXj9TNLlM
The kids from the @LittleLobbyists celebrated Halloween right here in the Capitol.

If President Trump were truly a champion for working Americans, he would show some leadership by urging his fellow Republicans in Congress to work with Democrats to protect pensions for construction workers, miners, truck drivers, and more. https://t.co/LLSXBOpD8E
