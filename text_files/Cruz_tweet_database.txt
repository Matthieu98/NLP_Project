Rabid partisan @johnjharwood was so biased for Dems in 2016 that he got NBC fired from moderating GOP debates. @kenvogel —a current NY Times &amp; former Politico reporter—reported on Ukrainian “efforts to sabotage Trump.” Harwood claims saying that makes you a Russian asset. #Pravda https://t.co/O2ushyx6CC
Definition: “Freud considered that, in projection, thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings that cannot be accepted as one's own are dealt with by being placed in the outside world and attributed to someone else.”  Hmm, does that mean @JeffBezos is a “Russian asset”? 🤔 https://t.co/gN29Qzo98J
WATCH.  It’s an abuse of the Constitution to use impeachment over just political differences.  But House Dems have now implicitly admitted, they cannot prove any crime or even any violation of federal law. #EndTheShowTrial https://t.co/9Cb37aVWQW
John, this is a flat-out lie &amp; you know it. You’re not supposed to be a partisan hack; you claim to be a “journalist.”  Report on these FACTS:  https://t.co/7Vp4eOLzdD https://t.co/mIn1gdrsO3
6/x @axios &amp; @chucktodd are deliberately LYING. They know there’s significant evidence of Ukrainian corruption, but they refuse to report it. When anyone points to actual facts, they scream “Russian conspiracy.” This isn’t journalism; it’s partisan propaganda. Chuck knows better.
5/x FACT 4: On 8/28/16, the Financial Times reported: “Kiev’s wider political leadership[did] something they would never have attempted before: INTERVENE, however indirectly, in a U.S. election.” Axios, was the Financial Times pushing a “conspiracy theory”?
4/x “...and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they HELPED Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found.” Axios, was Politico pushing a “conspiracy theory?”
3/x FACT 3:  Here’s what Politico reported on 1/11/17: “Ukrainian govt officials TRIED TO HELP Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption....”
2/x FACT 2: VP Biden bragged publicly about withholding $1 billion in aid until Ukraine fired the prosecutor investigating Burisma, the company paying his son $1mm/yr. Since MSM calls this a “conspiracy theory” &amp; ignores facts, WATCH the actual video: https://t.co/3AKurt9Kvb
@axios your bias is showing. Stop behaving like Schiff’s press secretary. Stop ignoring facts to push Dem narrative. This is why nobody trusts the media. Here are several FACTS that media chooses to ignore: (1) Hunter Biden was paid $83k a month from Ukraine’s biggest gas co. 1/x https://t.co/h6vzC6Av2l
Very painful. I did at least wear Rendon’s jersey, a native Texan who played tremendously at Rice &amp; Lamar High School. On the up side, the lunch also celebrated my winning bet w/ @SenGillibrand for the @Astros beating the Yankees. I brought TX BBQ &amp; she brought Buffalo wings. https://t.co/XdlOwEQHiC

Something I rarely say: I agree with Nancy Pelosi. Congress should NOT be passing special protections—statutory giveaways—for Big Tech. We should protect Free Speech and stand up to Silicon Valley’s blatant political censorship. https://t.co/cZ6iLU2Sdf

Um, your explicit “press” policy is that we will ONLY investigate &amp; attack @realDonaldTrump We will bar reporters from investigating or attacking ANY AND ALL Dem candidates (our brothers in arms). https://t.co/4I7965xLwe

This is, of course, not new:  Kurt Vonnegut’s 1961 classic Harrison Bergeron describes Bernie’s “socialist” sports powerfully.
Ben, that’s not nearly socialist enough. By govt mandate, all pitchers must now pitch the average speed—we’ll just redistribute MPH from fast pitchers to the slower pitchers. And no batter will be allowed to hit more than the league average. #FromEachAccordingToHisAbilities https://t.co/3tHQfVGghG
Big Tech at war with Democracy.   Silicon Valley billionaires, drunk with power, brazenly censor conservative speech &amp; now are openly engaged in voter suppression. #SillyVotersGoogleKnowsBest https://t.co/3funoP4Zk8
Brazen. What much of the MSM does already—investigate &amp; attack Trump relentlessly, but refuse to investigate or criticize Dems. But Bloomberg media is explicit. Unapologetic. It’s almost like they’re owned by a Dem presidential candidate.... https://t.co/OWi3u7stkv

Perfect! https://t.co/74USU2Q9bw
¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Not to worry:  Warren, Bernie &amp; the rest of the anti-job Dems will do everything they can to ban fracking, destroy 14mm American jobs &amp; make us more dependent on Russian oil. #HillaryMightCallThemRussianAssets https://t.co/cKSWAFZWeD

“Let the jury consider their verdict," the King said, for about the twentieth time that day. "No, no!" said the Queen. "Sentence first–verdict afterward." "Stuff and nonsense!" said Alice loudly.
Hmm. If you’re House Dems, and you’re trying to portray yourselves as impartial defenders of the Constitution, perhaps your articles of impeachment shouldn’t just be whatever your focus group says polls best? Sadly, facts don’t matter to the Dems or MSM. #VerdictFirstTrialSecond https://t.co/NFMq9HaA7H
Bravo. The right decision. https://t.co/AwqZwUL9Hk

Dan, completely right in principle. Conservatives support economic freedom; liberals support govt barriers to small business. The irony is BOTH Uber &amp; taxi cab unions give virtually all their political $$ to the Dems. Fortunately, most of the taxi and Uber drivers are voting GOP! https://t.co/KBcb8AEV0Q
Outrageous. I am sure that all the Dems &amp; MSM pundits breathlessly opining on the sanctity of whistleblowers will rush to the defense of Daleiden for blowing the whistle on Planned Parenthood’s facially illegal conduct here.... https://t.co/Cr9rFnFVPp
This may be the single most ridiculous claim of the Dem show trial. No, the President’s tweeting is not “witness intimidation.” You may not like the tone of some or even many of his tweets, but it’s absurd to suggest that tweeting is an impeachable “high Crime [or] Misdemeanor.” https://t.co/afuu4OWUb3
“Suck it up and watch.” Sums up the Dems/MSM approach to their political show trial. https://t.co/xxwhEGa05n
Important point, often ignored by media/Dems/Foggy Bottom. Article 2 of the Constitution provides, “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.”  If Deep State disagrees, they should run for President. https://t.co/yKqakuZTAZ

Not “halt.” Delay to fully consider the evidence. If he’s guilty, the sentence should be carried out. But if he’s innocent, he should be freed. https://t.co/Y7MdlPkWkI

This is a remarkable bipartisan coalition. Having spent yrs in law enforcement, I believe capital punishment can be justice for the very worst murderers, but if there is credible evidence there’s a real chance the defendant is innocent, that evidence should be weighed carefully. https://t.co/kaph6D5J6N
