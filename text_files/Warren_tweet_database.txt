Governor Northam, you have the opportunity to empower unions and working families. You should take it. https://t.co/laaNjR2yzbI'm so grateful for Amber Torres's support and I will fight to ensure the United States meets its trust and treaty obligations. https://t.co/t50J8ixOIeThis is cruel and appalling. These students simply dreamed of getting the high-quality higher education America can offer. ICE deceived and entrapped them, just to deport them. https://t.co/t6kQLiV5ohI'm proud to stand alongside @Deb4CongressNM in the fight to ensure that the United States honors its promises and commitments to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples. https://t.co/qjTZybxL37At its best, America is a place for big dreams and second chances. That’s what I’ve always fought for, and that’s the America I want us to build together. https://t.co/j42UClCodhThe Trump administration's cruel and dangerous policies are putting children in danger and driving families apart. When I'm president, I'll end his racist policies and welcome immigrants and asylum seekers. https://t.co/Sm91Xp9nClPresidential candidates typically do "call time"—also known as calling wealthy donors and asking for big checks.

Not me. Our campaign is funded by grassroots donors like you. Will you pitch in now? https://t.co/1tDuvv0GYuGoogle recently hired a notorious union-busting firm—and yesterday, fired four employees who were organizing their colleagues and holding Google accountable. I stand with Rebecca Rivers and her colleagues. I’ll always fight to protect workers’ rights. https://t.co/dUIsEd58jYMonopolies are bad for consumers and our economy—and they're bad for employees, too.

But when workers build a grassroots movement and fight together to hold Big Tech companies like Amazon accountable, they can win. https://t.co/XQ1Iku6zppDream big, fight hard, put on your sweatshirt, and let’s get to work! https://t.co/JP6wo9OkNpYup, I’m tired of “Woe Is Me” billionaires too, @TrevorNoah. My #WealthTax will help families afford child care, college, and free an entire generation from student loan debt—and the billionaires will be just fine. https://t.co/JrkfTPqkt8Some billionaires figured it might be cheaper to run for president than pay my #WealthTax. Well they don’t have the power of a grassroots movement—and in our democracy, I believe in the power of people over money. https://t.co/tDo1Rjg4WMFighting for the #GreenNewDeal isn't just about fighting climate change. It's a commitment to building a better future for the working people of our country by creating millions of good union jobs. We can’t fight climate change with a low-wage economy.We need to build a new farm economy that is truly open to all. I’ve listened to Black farmers and updated my plan to reflect their experiences. We must root out structural racism to ensure Black farmers succeed. https://t.co/Y9AUKDxHDyWe need bold action now to pass the #GreenNewDeal, build a green new economy, and defeat the climate crisis—and I've got a plan for that. I'm proud to work alongside groups like @SunriseMvmt to build the grassroots movement we need to fight climate change. https://t.co/GHJKDCloowAfter my daddy's heart attack, he couldn't work for a while. So my mother got a minimum wage job—and that job saved our house. She was scared, but she found the strength to do what needed to be done to save our family. https://t.co/oeMFWT4Jq5I’ve got a lot of plans to bring big, structural change to Washington. But first, there's one plan that makes it all possible: Making sure we hit our monthly fundraising goals.

Can I count on you to pitch in to our grassroots movement before midnight? https://t.co/W0M93uwDUUPrivate companies shouldn't be able to profit off of incarcerated people by charging them to read a book or video call their family. My plan for criminal justice reform will rein in this exploitation. https://t.co/WY2oZ41229I've proposed the biggest and most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly half a century—an immediate $200 monthly increase. Families need financial security.Nominating top donors to be ambassadors undermines U.S. diplomacy and national security—and I’ve got a plan to end this practice. https://t.co/wb8fnVZtaYMichael Bloomberg may think he doesn't need people to win this election—he just needs bags of money.

He’s wrong. That's why I'm investing in meeting thousands of voters, taking over 85,000 selfies, and building a grassroots movement that will fight for big, structural change. https://t.co/DZftlFvyqiExperts agree: Broad student debt cancellation would supercharge economic growth by freeing a generation crushed by debt. Candidates who oppose it should explain why punishing young people matters more than promoting home ownership and business creation. https://t.co/9UUPYUYWYEWe need public financing of our elections. But manipulating the rules to attack @WorkingFamilies and push them off the ballot is wrong. https://t.co/2XKWwUZj8vThe same communities that have borne the brunt of industrial pollution are also on the front lines of the climate crisis—and extreme weather events could put them at even greater risk. We have to end the climate crisis and clean up Superfund sites. https://t.co/YfFmb6H16SI'm in this fight because I want our kids to have a brighter future.

I’m so proud to be fighting alongside you for big, structural change. https://t.co/Ob3pfPKqfXFor months, the people of Hong Kong have taken to the streets to stand up for their rights. This weekend, they went to the ballot box and sent the powerful message that they want to keep their democracy—and Beijing must respect that. https://t.co/tEvUKsz0zuLet’s be clear: Our government criminalizes too many things and sends too many people to jail. In a Warren administration, we will: 

☑️ Repeal the 1994 Crime Bill 
☑️ Legalize marijuana
☑️ Undo the legacy of the War on Drugs
☑️ End cash bail and private prisonsHistory has proven that when working women fight together, they win. The Black women of the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike show the true story of American persistence. https://t.co/9ht7ophMNxThere have been 2,302 mass shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook. We shouldn't have to live like this. But unless we root out corruption in Washington, the gun lobby will always have a veto on any legislation to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/QPx0DtRGIAI support the students, organizers, and activists demanding accountability on climate action and more at #HarvardYale. Climate change is an existential threat, and we must take bold action to fight this crisis. https://t.co/lm1V6honI4My heart is with @LucyMcBath today. Jordan Davis should be alive. We must call out the fact that Black Americans have borne the brunt of the gun violence tragedy in our country. I promise to fight my heart out—for justice for Jordan, and to end this epidemic. https://t.co/XbUxZTwpz9I’m glad everyone is enjoying the Bailey photos we sent out yesterday!

For more updates from our grassroots campaign (and maybe more photos in the future), add your name: https://t.co/5lxWK3Lvoi https://t.co/x27J367k7kThis guy was Mick Mulvaney’s right-hand man in Congress. Now, he has a plum job as a payday loan lobbyist and is cozying up to Mulvaney to advance his clients’ interests.

In a Warren administration, we’ll stand up to lobbyists and the predatory loan industry. https://t.co/ShreGlDn4L@maddygunawan It was great meeting you, Maddy. Thanks for being in this fight!Mike Bloomberg is placing $34 million in TV ads in one week—the most of any presidential candidate in history.

That’s one way to pay less under my #WealthTax. Because in a Warren administration, he and his billionaire friends would finally have to pay their fair share. https://t.co/qWHtk37zaMI’m grateful to have you in this fight, @bjoewolf. Together, we’ll keep fighting to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/eCDVw2PcysUnlike other candidates, I don’t host fancy fundraisers, I don’t take money from PACs, and I don’t cozy up to billionaires.

Instead, small-dollar donors are the backbone of our grassroots campaign. Donate whatever you can now, and join the fight! https://t.co/EBLSASRJNBDonald Trump is a walking, talking conflict of interest. It should be illegal for a president to twist the rules of our government to make themselves richer. Under my anti-corruption bill—the biggest since Watergate—it would be. https://t.co/icKIZvutSv.@JayInslee is exactly right. The Keystone XL pipeline is a harmful project that locks us into further dependence on some of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet.

What an honor to be with @BlackWomxnFor and @AyannaPressley at @CAU last night. https://t.co/J1TEOfY1QaThis isn’t about drivers’ licenses or the Census.

We must be honest about our history, and do what’s right so that our nation can begin to heal. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Lsl47JezpMWhite supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair. Now more than ever, all of us must embrace the lessons of Black history to confront this challenge. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/iPVwOk33HIRacism props up the rich and powerful, leaving them free to take more power for themselves.

And you can't be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we've fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarrenWe're live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Tc7WIWuUukDonald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan.See you soon! https://t.co/YEAPDgA6OIClimate change is an existential threat—and unless we take urgent action to end this crisis, future generations will face catastrophic consequences.

And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3SThe way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll.Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34KAwood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAruI won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that.This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylCWe're not leaving yet, Atlanta! Join us at @CAU on Thursday, where I'll be sharing the stories of some of the most persistent and fearless fighters, Black women who proved that when working women fight together, they win. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/XDcLiZccSLTo everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

I’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together. https://t.co/6Wir1mdB46The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7AI believe that abortion rights are human rights.

I believe that they're also economic rights.

And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. #DemDebate https://t.co/kDrlXSKr4ZI’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebateI just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlTWe have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebateIn my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3eI’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It's time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9yAbortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebateWhen I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebateRight now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebateWe need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here's what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:
✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k
✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools
✅ $50 billion in HBCUs
✅ Cancel student loan debt
#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqROur defense budget is massively bloated—we need to end the cozy relationship between defense contractors and the Pentagon, then pull out a sharp knife and make real cuts. I've got a plan for that. #DemDebate https://t.co/n4M5U2JJjNAll three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has toward military personnel and their families. And I’ve got a plan to honor our promises to our nation’s veterans, service members, military families, and survivors. #DemDebate https://t.co/pyMfCKdTgmFor decades, racist redlining practices blocked Black and Brown families from home ownership and building wealth. My housing plan helps level the playing field for families who were denied wealth-building opportunities. #DemDebate https://t.co/vb84trHx3OChild care is personal for me. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child. It’ll be free for millions of families, and affordable for all. Use my calculator to see how much your family would save: https://t.co/urL0bLuxrgBillionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04hTens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.

My #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebateLet me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:

✔️ Universal Child Care
✔️ Universal pre-k
✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools
✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs
✔️ Cancel student loan debt 

#DemDebateMy #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebateThe way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebateThe Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That's what's happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebateToday’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebatePoliticians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. I stand with @StaceyAbrams—and that's why I have a plan to guarantee the right to vote and end voter suppression. https://t.co/wRvU1FR0yJI had a wonderful time meeting Lily and her friend Jenny. Lily donated just $10 and won the @TeamWarren contest to join me at tonight's #DemDebate in Atlanta!

We're going to make big, structural change, together. https://t.co/vcb8uQInF3Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetimes. In a Warren administration, we’ll root out Washington corruption once and for all.

From raising the federal minimum wage, to fighting systemic discrimination, to protecting Latina workers’ rights to unionize—I'm ready to fight on day one. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/54WDOq56co https://t.co/fgYdvNpscq37 million Americans didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. 
36 million skipped a recommended test or treatment because of costs. 
40 million didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs.
This should never happen. It's time for #MedicareForAll.On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we #SayTheirNames, and we re-commit to ending this epidemic. #TDoR https://t.co/6mTLM2grTqI’m fighting my heart out for Rachael, for Carl, for baby Willow—and for you, @AdyBarkan.

(P.S. Willow: Your dad is an inspiration. I’m so honored to know him, and to fight alongside him for a better future for all.) https://t.co/PUqORwiJdaWe wouldn't be this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without activists like @AdyBarkan, who has given his life to ensure that every American gets the medical care they need. I’m grateful down to my toes to be in this fight alongside you, Ady. https://t.co/jAo8dTcaAMI’m deeply grateful to have your support in this fight, @AdyBarkan. I make this promise to you, to Willow, and to every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. 

We’re going to do this—side by side. Together. https://t.co/rS6PQvdNNBWhite nationalist violence is a domestic terrorism threat—and we must treat it like one. I've got a plan to fight white nationalist violence. And when I'm president, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. https://t.co/AkO27jkySXI'm standing with the Indiana teachers rallying for their schools. We need to invest in public education and our public school teachers. They're fighting for our students, so we should be fighting for them, too. #RedForEd https://t.co/QEzq5MwOlZWe are facing a Black maternal mortality crisis in America. This is life and death for too many moms and babies. I've got a plan to end this epidemic. Thank you @NVPartnersLV and @StevenHorsford for welcoming me to the Black Community Summit. https://t.co/f6UpP3a1IuWhite nationalism has no place in our country, our White House, or our Congress. Let's start by getting Steve King out of office and electing @JDScholten to replace him. #IA04I'm proud to fight alongside @AyannaPressley for the big, structural change we need—and so happy to announce that she'll be one of my special guests for my speech in Atlanta on Thursday! https://t.co/xbMgOhMCoSFrom the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/AsdbVDKbscOur alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyvI introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2WWe need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7fUltimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgvI will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bHMy plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmfStephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.Mother Emanuel AME Church.
Charlottesville.
Tree of Life Synagogue.
El Paso.
Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePgMillions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I’ve got a plan to make housing more affordable, protect renters from unjust eviction and discrimination, and invest in healthy and green homes. 

Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to live. https://t.co/rWDJr8EXIFThe way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win! https://t.co/NyOX0QhIhsEveryone deserves a safe, affordable place to live—and I'm committed to fighting to protect tenants’ rights. Thank you @MakeRoadActNV and @CPDAction for joining me today to discuss my plan to protect and empower renting families! https://t.co/S7PZs8miEBThe forceful removal of @NJWFA State Director @SueAltman from a public hearing is outrageous. I stand with her and @WorkingFamilies. https://t.co/DEaJiC6iQA
