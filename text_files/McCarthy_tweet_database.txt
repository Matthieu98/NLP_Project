Democrats have relied on smears, hearsay, and presumption to build their false impeachment narrative. The good news is that the American people can see right through their guilty-until-proven-innocent justice system.
House Democrats have been trying to undo the results of President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs historic election since before he was sworn in. After countless hours of wasted time, Chairman Schiff has only succeeded in exposing this sham for what it is ‚Üí a political hit job.
Looks like we‚Äôve reached amateur hour of the partisan impeachment sham. We are within a 48-hour window of when the next hearing is set to begin &amp; the American public still has no idea what witnesses Chairman Nadler plans to call.

Dems continue to sacrifice fairness for speed.
NAFTA lists telegrams as a means of communication...but makes NO MENTION of the Internet. That's how outdated our trade agreement is with Mexico and Canada.

Speaker Pelosi, let us vote on #USMCAnow. https://t.co/oyzFtjA14O
Democrats are moving full speed ahead on their impeachment sham despite bipartisan OPPOSITION in the House.
With less than a year away from a presidential election, the questions I hear most from my constituents:
1‚Äì Why don‚Äôt Dems trust voters to make the decision?
2‚Äì How much is this impeachment costing?
3‚Äì When is Congress going to do something else‚Äîlike #USMCA or lower drug prices?
Spent many a Saturday working the counter at Kevin O‚Äôs Deli back before #SmallBusinessSaturday was cool. Small and local businesses deserve to be recognized‚Äîthey are the engine that moves our economy and makes America a country where dreams are realized. https://t.co/GF481dH1bn
A year ago today, President Trump signed #USMCA with Canadian and Mexican leaders. Speaker Pelosi calls it the ‚Äúeasiest trade deal‚Äù, but a year later this bill‚Äîwhich would benefit hardworking Americans‚Äîsits in legislative purgatory. Enough partisan games‚Äîlet‚Äôs pass #USMCAnow.
Chairman Adam Schiff proclaimed himself the Special Prosecutor in this impeachment sham. And you know what Special Prosecutors have to do? Testify. 

Mueller did. Starr did. Schiff should too.
Democrats are saying they didn‚Äôt go to Washington to impeach President Trump, but their actions say otherwise. They voted to impeach 
‚û°Ô∏è before the Mueller Report was released
‚û°Ô∏è before reading the phone transcript

The American people see this impeachment for what it is‚Äîa sham.
Today and every day, I‚Äôm thankful to be living in the greatest country on earth.

With @POTUS‚Äô signature on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, we showed America‚Äôs commitment to supporting freedom in the face of oppression. Beijing can‚Äôt silence those who seek democracy, and we will continue our longstanding support for a free Hong Kong. üá∫üá∏üá≠üá∞

The first person who should testify in a Judiciary Committee hearing about impeachment is Chairman Adam Schiff.

He has A LOT to answer for.
Democrats' town hall meetings aren't going well. Now many of them are back in their districts trying to claim that they didn't come to Washington to impeach the president‚Äîafter already voting for it. https://t.co/vtX3RY3lZN
What if I told you...
‚áí He won the election.
‚áí He spoke for millions who didn‚Äôt have a voice.
‚áí Despite their obstruction, he is still getting things done for the American people. https://t.co/ZuVq1Jl9RG
With their vote, the people of Hong Kong delivered a strong rebuke of the authoritarian policies of Beijing. They came out in record numbers, nearly double the last election, to support pro-democracy candidates. When people have a choice, they will always choose freedom.
Democrats are so concerned about losing to @realDonaldTrump again in the next election that they feel have to impeach him.

The biggest losers in this impeachment sham are American citizens. Democrats have been so focused on impeachment they have ignored:
‚á® Securing our border
‚á® Lowering prescription drug prices
‚á® Strengthening our economy with #USMCA
Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs quest to impeach a duly-elected president is nothing like she said it would be.
Overwhelming evidence? ‚ùå
Compelling case? ‚ùå
Bi-partisan support? ‚ùå

But she‚Äôs right on one thing: this nightmare is tearing our nation apart. https://t.co/SxrU7UqMQ4
Chairman Adam Schiff wants to change the results of the 2016 election so badly, he will continue to lie and put America through this nightmare. https://t.co/XfX9imSATn
Democrats ran on impeachment, voted for it before reading the Mueller Report, and continue to push it without any actual evidence to support their claims.

Their cause is clear ‚á® to remove a duly-elected president that they cannot beat at the ballot box.
