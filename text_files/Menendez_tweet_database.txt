Since Donald Trump took office, 40,000 FEWER New Jerseyans have health coverage‚Äîa drop of nearly 14%. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so critical to get the word out. Tell your friends, family and neighbors to sign up at https://t.co/qOu9NkGg1m https://t.co/b8NvfwNuOB
We are 1 WEEK away from the 12/15 ACA enrollment deadline. Getting covered is not just about protecting the health &amp; well-being of you and your loved ones, but ensuring you‚Äôre not one illness or one injury away from financial ruin. Just head to https://t.co/qOu9NkGg1m to sign up. https://t.co/dvPMpoyOv8
Tragically, Iran continues to pursue unjust, political detentions of its own citizens, Americans, and other foreigners.

While we celebrate the release of Mr. Wang we cannot forget Robert Levinson, Michael White, and Baquer and Siamak Namazi and others unjustly detained.

It was good to join @LaRedHispana today to discuss the health care challenges facing the Latino community in the U.S. Tenemos que proteger el acceso a la salud de nuestra comunidad. Adelante! https://t.co/owz3Hey5BW
Steven Menashi has weakened Title IX protections, worked hand-in-hand with Stephen Miller, and helped advance Betsy DeVos‚Äô reign of terror on our education system.

Menashi is not looking to protect America. Point blank. Proud to vote NO on his nomination. #StopMenashi https://t.co/zFErSx1NgU
Given the tenor of our political times and the public health challenges we face, I fear that politicians will use this loophole to spread health misinformation.

I urge @Facebook to take immediate action.
.@blakersdozen has been covering the anti-vax ads consistently. His new article with @tayhatmaker explains @Facebook‚Äôs loophole for anti-vax content and other dangerous health misinformation. https://t.co/FrKCcBlj2X
New letter to Mark Zuckerberg.

@Facebook has failed to stem the tide of dangerous myths about vaccinations on its platform &amp; I‚Äôve become more concerned that its policy on political speech contains a loophole that would allow the spread of health misinformation to go unchecked. https://t.co/bRk3IFDBJa
In every session of Congress since 2006, I‚Äôve introduced or cosponsored legislation affirming the facts of the #ArmenianGenocide.

Despite yesterday‚Äôs objection to my resolution, I won‚Äôt stop fighting until the Senate finally recognizes this historical fact.
Genocide is genocide. In order to prevent the atrocities of the future, we must recognize and commemorate those of the past. #ArmenianGenocide #SRes150 https://t.co/xomhqAVl6i
Tell us something we didn‚Äôt already know: Trump‚Äôs racist, xenophobic immigration policy is being run by a white nationalist. https://t.co/1t5hygLZsn
To save our oceans, there is no time to waste. We must pass #SaveOurSeas 2.0! @SenWhitehouse @SenDanSullivan  https://t.co/er5BIJ3ZvH

I appreciated the opportunity to meet with @jensstoltenberg to discuss what more @NATO can be doing to counter Russia. Foreign Relations Committee members also discussed the role of Turkey in NATO in the wake of its purchase of the S-400 from Russia. https://t.co/nkyM5fqRZe
The increase of hate crimes in our state and around the country is unacceptable.

New Jersey should be the leader in tolerance and acceptance.

Hatred is not welcome here‚Äîperiod. https://t.co/1n0IZJvIvO
The confirmation of Chad Wolf is the latest example of how the Trump Administration‚Äîwith the help of @SenateGOP‚Äîis bypassing our constitutional duty to advise and consent in key nominations such as heading the Department of Homeland Security. https://t.co/zjDBFz3frH
Solid ruling from Judge Lasnik. But it‚Äôs absolutely unacceptable that the Trump Admin is FIGHTING in courts to allow blueprints for 3-D printed guns to be posted online.

Anyone can buy a 3-D printer &amp; make themselves a firearm‚Äîwithout a background check. That‚Äôs downright scary. https://t.co/ZntTgS9XUO
Just reintroduced #VAWA since @senatemajldr has failed to hold a vote on it‚Äîeven though the House already passed it.

Once again, the inaction from @SenateGOP is inexcusable. Survivors of domestic and sexual violence deserve better. https://t.co/AfvBA9bV8H
Big news for #SaveOurSeas! ‚úÖ We need to bring this to a full Senate vote so we can tackle plastic pollution at the source. https://t.co/0605lXhOxI
The President says he wants to put ‚ÄòAmerica First.‚Äô

Yet on every one of these ten issues, Trump has cowered to the demands of Ankara and Moscow.
üîü Will Trump call out Turkey‚Äôs relationship with Hamas, the Palestinian organization that continues to terrorize Israel on a daily basis?

Will he stand by our ally #Israel, or will his personal interests and affinity for strongmen win out once again?
9Ô∏è‚É£ Will Trump ignore Erdogan‚Äôs violations of the @UN arms embargo on #Libya?
8Ô∏è‚É£ Will Trump accept efforts by Turkey to convert Hagia Sophia, which was the largest Greek Orthodox Church in the world for more than 1,000 years, into a mosque?

Will he advocate for the religious freedom of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew?
7Ô∏è‚É£ Will Trump ignore the violent attacks by Erdogan‚Äôs security detail in 2017 against peaceful protestors and DC police?
6Ô∏è‚É£ Will Trump call out Erdogan‚Äôs assault on the democratic process in Turkey?

Will he stick up for civil society groups, university professors and others who‚Äôve been unjustly detained?

Will he stick up for journalists there, even as he demonizes the #FreePress here at home?
5Ô∏è‚É£ Will Trump condemn or accept Erdogan‚Äôs warming relationship with the Russian Federation?
4Ô∏è‚É£ Will Trump stand up to Turkish aggression against its neighbors throughout the region?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Will Trump accept the commission of war crimes in Syria by Turkish-backed forces?

The war crimes that he in effect invited #Turkey to commit when he greenlighted its invasion of #Syria?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Will Trump sanction the activities of Halkbank, a Turkish institution that facilitated the biggest evasion of Iran sanctions in history?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Will Turkey reverse course from Erdogan‚Äôs decision to buy and receive the S-400 air defense system from #Russia?
Pres. Trump should instead use this visit to actually stand up for America, for our principles, and for our allies.

And he can do this by raising the many serious questions that #Turkey has yet to address, such as‚Ä¶
When President Trump welcomes Turkish President Erdogan to the White House today, he will be welcoming a known authoritarian, human rights abuser and friend to Putin whose behavior increasingly runs counter to the interests of the United States and our allies. https://t.co/ZwjpeGRvGz
Tragic news and unclear circumstances. The White Helmets are Nobel Peace Prize-winning heroes. Russia‚Äôs smear campaign against their brave work is unacceptable. There must be accountability and justice.

I urge Turkish authorities to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation. https://t.co/HGJW3aDU4I
Deeply concerned for the safety of all Israelis under threat from Hamas‚Äô indiscriminate rocket attacks.

Israel has the absolute right to defend itself and its citizens. https://t.co/PYfq0A27pr
The Administration‚Äôs incompetence and negligence when it comes to vetting nominees continues to astound me. https://t.co/S4sVTg1LLL
"The Trump Admin's unlawful rescission of DACA was a tragic mistake‚Ä¶that not only hurts #Dreamers &amp; their families, but also undermines our nation‚Äôs ability to compete in a global market for talent.‚Äù

True. Read why leaders at Princeton &amp; Microsoft want a permanent solution üëá https://t.co/6wJDEwF3Nc
Hong Kong authorities must ensure that police act professionally and with restraint, and address the legitimate aspirations of the people of Hong Kong.

The Senate must act NOW to pass my #HongKong Human Rights and Democracy Act.
It's been half a year since #HongKong citizens took to the streets in the millions to protest the erosion of democracy and their rights.

Violence against students and protestors is rising‚Äîsome of the worst seen in the city in decades. https://t.co/Ae4yPdKoD2
