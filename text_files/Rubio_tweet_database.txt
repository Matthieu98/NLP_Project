Investigators worked through the night here in #Pensacola. It‚Äôs important we learn how &amp; why this attack happened so we can fix any shortcomings in our vetting of foreign military traininees. 

Because this is an important program for NAS Pensacola &amp; America. https://t.co/GBz63NjK7j

Just finished my visit to NAS Pensacola. Thank you to those from @FBI @FBIJacksonville &amp; NCIS working long hours &amp; the @SalvationArmyUS volunteers providing meals

Soon everyone will learn the stories of heroism of so many Master At Arms, airmen,sailors,&amp; Sheriff deputies
I am arriving soon at NAS #Pensacola saddened by the loss of life,in awe of the bravery of so many &amp; confident the relevant agencies will conduct the thorough investigation the public &amp; victims deserve &amp; the safety of those in uniform requires.
I support a free market capitalist economy

A free market will always reach the most efficient outcome

Military trainees aren‚Äôt allowed into these programs if the vetting turns up any derogatory information &amp; our foreign partners that conducts their own vetting as well

But today‚Äôs tragic attack has exposed some serious flaw in that process which must be discovered &amp; corrected 2/2
Todays attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola is both tragic &amp; deeply disturbing. 

Foreign military aviators sent to the U.S. for training undergo extensive security &amp; suitability vetting. 

And no student is allowed to carry weapons inside this facility. 1/2
All key federal agencies are involved in the investigation of the shooting at Naval Air Pensacola

Early on they will be guarded in what they share with the public not in an effort to keep conceal information but to avoid providing potentially inaccurate or incomplete information
It‚Äôs possible today‚Äôs attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola was motivated by a personal grievance &amp; not ideology, but it has 
many of the markings of an act motivated by international terrorism.

We will know more very soon.
Just spoke to commanding officer of Naval Air Station Pensacola. We are in close contact with all the relevant officials &amp; closely monitoring events. Please pray for everyone impacted by this horrible situation.
Stupefy yourselves and stay stupid;blind yourselves and stay blind!
You who are drunk, but not from wine,who stagger, but not from strong drink! For the LORD has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep. He has shut your eyes and covered your heads.

Today we are introducing a bi-partisan Senate resolution honoring the many off the field contributions made by former @MiamiDolphins &amp; @Patriots great Nick Buoniconti.

‚ÄòCommon Good Capitalism‚Äô is an economy built on private enterprise &amp; a limited government with economic policies that incentivize the creation of dignified work &amp; protect the national interest.

The central goal of our economic policies should be to have a vibrant private economy in which American companies make a profit AND create dignified &amp; stable work for Americans. https://t.co/iuGy5j0lEI

.@NicolasMaduro plan in #Venezuela: 

-divide opposition by co-opting or bribing some into endorsing early fraudulent @AsambleaVE ‚Äúelection‚Äù

-those who don‚Äôt agree forced to boycott fake election

-electoral council manipulates votes to guarantee regime takes over natl assembly
Neither socialism nor our economic status quo will result in the economy we need &amp; want for America.

Our nation doesn‚Äôt exist to serve the interests of the government or the market. 

The government &amp; market exist to serve the interest of our nation.

The retirement funds of federal government employees, including members of the military, should not be invested in companies controlled by government of #China. 

If hope the TSP board takes action on this.

But if they don‚Äôt then Congress must.  https://t.co/9HbadLB2oa
We are working with everyone to pass our #HongKong bill but we aren‚Äôt going to let anyone run out the clock on us

At some point very soon it will be time to act

One way or another we will have a vote &amp; those who oppose it will have to explain why

Congratulations to my friend @JasonMiyaresVA who was re-elected to a 3rd term in #Virginia last night.

What he said last night about his district can be said about America:

‚ÄúDespite all the division that is going on nationally, this is fundamentally a good and decent community‚Äù
It is good for the man gracious in lending,who conducts his affairs with justice.For he shall never be shaken;the righteous shall be remembered forever.He shall not fear an ill report;his heart is steadfast,trusting the LORD.His heart is tranquil,without fear,...

Ps 112:5-8
A recent election security training exercise pitting real federal and law enforcement officials against a mysterious cyber group aiming to disrupt and undermine voter confidence used many of the exact tactics I warned about over one year ago

The way forward for America is not socialism or a disordered economy that neglects the creation of dignified work.

We need Common Good Capitalism in which the private sector &amp; workers fulfill their obligations to each other &amp; the country is better for it. https://t.co/tofRmfcdSk
The brutal massacre of members of the LeBar√≥n family demonstrates the challenges posed by the violence &amp; human rights violations of drug cartels in #Mexico
 
Pleased that @POTUS is prepared to provide any additional help Mexico requests to combat these killers.
.@tiktok_us  claims they have never been asked by the govt of #China ‚Äúto remove any content &amp; would not do so if asked. Period." 

But former employees detailed how inside company U.S. views about censorship often were overridden by Chinese bosses https://t.co/2GXTRUvtvV
Do not grow slack in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, endure in affliction, persevere in prayer.

Who governs #Haiti a decision for Haitian people &amp; U.S. supports &amp; will help facilitate a peaceful &amp; democratic process for them to do so

But while we will not dictate the political outcome political leaders should know that those responsible for HR abuses will face sanctions
Last month I asked @USTreasury to conduct a CFIUS review of @tiktok_us. Because any platform owned by a company in #China which collects massive amounts of data on Americans is a potential serious threat to our country. 

 https://t.co/iCvizN8Vhf
Govt leaders in #Haiti should not confuse an unwillingness to interfere in their internal politics with tolerance for violence against protestors &amp; journalists. They have an obligation to uphold the rule of law &amp; will face consequences if responsible for human rights abuses.
This is the day the LORD has made;let us rejoice in it and be glad.

Psalms 118:24
Cuban human rights activist &amp; leader of #UNPACU @jdanielferrer, has been detained by the regime since Oct 1st.
 
Ferrer &amp; UNPACU remain being targets of the dictatorship. The int'l community should hold the regime accountable for Ferrer‚Äôs life as well as his family's #FreeFerrer
Yet another reminder of why the Senate needs to pass our #HongKongHumanRightsAndDemocracyAct. #China‚Äôs continuous efforts to undermine #HongKong‚Äôs autonomy demonstrates the need for a strong response now. It‚Äôs time to put it on the Senate floor for a vote. https://t.co/jbhwAuq7Zj
Threat to elections isn‚Äôt limited to #Putin

#China is wiping out entire sectors of our economy,creating leverage over our people &amp; working to supplant the U.S. in the world. 

Why don‚Äôt we spend more time working on &amp; covering this &amp; a little less on the daily drama &amp; endless partisan games?

By law, every company in #China including the owners of @tiktok_us must turn over data to Communist Party if asked.

#tiktok isn‚Äôt just a source of catchy videos,its a source of the valuable personal data of millions of U.S. teenagers.

The @espn guys are wrong. 

Shedding bad contracts, moving players that will not be here when you are finally good &amp; trading Drake (who was gone next year anyway for no compensation at all) is not tanking. Its good front office housekeeping that sets you up to rebuild. #FinsUp https://t.co/oOnKv40tw0
I will be on Fox News/Fox &amp; Friends at 8:10am Eastern Time.  Lots to talk about this morning.

Should the retirement funds of federal employees be used to capitalize companies in #China that violate human rights &amp; steal U.S. secrets? 

The answer is no! 

Think of the leverage this gives Beijing over government employees now &amp; when they retire.

The operation that killed the degenerate #baghdadi was named after a real hero Kayla Mueller who despite the most horrific treatment at the hands of #ISIS displayed courage &amp; selflessness while in captivity &amp; refused to renounce her Christian faith.  https://t.co/crjEvnDC3O
Today we should also remember the thousands of victims of #alBaghdadi‚Äôs crimes. 

In particular I am thinking of our friends @artsotloff &amp; Shirley Sotloff whose son Steven was brutally murdered by #ISIS killers.
operation that eliminated #alBaghdadi was possible because of on the ground intelligence gathered over many months &amp; made possible by our presence &amp; relationships on the ground. This is why it is wise to retain a presence in #Syria &amp; the region.
The U.S. operation which killed the founder &amp; leader of #ISIS is a very significant achievement which ALL Americans should take pride in &amp; the world should be grateful for. 

It will not end ISIS but it is a major blow to its propaganda &amp; recruitment efforts.
...for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.

Well-deserved award for Ilham Tothi‚Äôs tireless efforts to promote harmony between Chinese and Uyghurs. His courage in the face  of the Chinese Communist Party's repression is why I nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. https://t.co/6fEXTd0HTx
Reports of U.S. ‚Äúdeploying tanks‚Äù to eastern #Syria are about what I tweeted 2 days ago.  

It isn‚Äôt about protecting oil companies. It is about preventing #ISIS #Iran or #Assad from taking the oil fields &amp; about preserving some anti-ISIS partnership with SDF. https://t.co/b5qMh0VRce

El r√©gimen criminal de @NicolasMaduro le ha subcontratado patrullas en partes de la frontera de #Venezuela con #Colombia a las #FARC, un grupo narco-terrorista.

Es hora que EE. UU. designe a ese r√©gimen como una organizaci√≥n terrorista. https://t.co/ERP1wezvgo
The criminal regime of @NicolasMaduro has outsourced patrols of parts of #Venezuela‚Äôs border with #Colombia to the #FARC a narco-terror group. 

It is time for the U.S. to designate this regime as a terrorist organization.
RT below appears to be direction administration may go in eastern #Syria

Meanwhile after yesterdays deal between Putin &amp; Erdogan:

- #Turkey aligned fighters took over Arab/Kurdish town of Ras al Ayn &amp; promptly began to loot civlian homes

Under the @NicolasMaduro crime family food &amp; other goods in #Venezuela is increasingly available only to those who have U.S. dollars. 

Which means the poor &amp; the rank in file members of the military go hungry,while the corrupt with links to the regime have everything.
Two things are true

There‚Äôs only been ONE man EVER who was always right &amp; deserves blind loyalty &amp; his name was Jesus;

And

No matter what a Republican does the left will never be fair to them. What they want is Republicans who will douse themselves in kerosene &amp; light a match.
