70 years after the founding of NATO, we must repair the strained relationships with our European allies. Not because we owe them or they owe us, but because America is safer and stronger when we work with strong and able partners—and when those partners can trust America’s word.
The freedom to live a healthy life is an essential part of the American promise—yet millions find their health determined by who they are or where they live. I will make achieving health equity a strategic priority during my first 100 days in office.

.@GovernorBullock joined this race to guarantee a fair shot for all, including communities that often go overlooked in our politics. I'm grateful to him for his service and I look forward to working with him to build a better future for all Americans. https://t.co/oEWmT87eu4
Today, we remember the victims of the San Bernardino attack.

Today, tomorrow, and the next day, we'll continue demanding action.

It's past time for Washington to act on the threat of gun violence and keep our communities safe.
The freedom to organize is an American freedom. That’s why I’m proud to stand with @Culinary226 workers in their fight for their rights at Station Casinos in Nevada. https://t.co/UnaI0OBxyH
Thank you @RevDrBarber and @UniteThePoor for the warm welcome. It was an honor to worship with you and I look forward to working alongside you as we serve those who are most vulnerable and most in need. https://t.co/hZQMPLfeJI
On #WorldAIDSDay, we mourn the lives we've lost, stand with those living with HIV/AIDS, and set our eyes on a new era. I will use the powers of the presidency to tear down walls of exclusion and banish HIV/AIDS by 2030. https://t.co/7O4FnG4CYM
Saddened by the loss of Hoosier William Ruckelshaus, who will be remembered for refusing to carry out the orders of a president trying to cover up his crimes. We will never all agree on every issue, but we should all strive to follow his example. https://t.co/nXJ9ejGkNI
Small businesses begin as acts of hope and go on to fuel our economy. This #SmallBusinessSaturday, support veteran, women, and minority-owned small businesses, and help open new doors of opportunity for their owners, our communities, and our country.
This Black Friday, thank the department store clerk who gave up Thanksgiving dinner with her family for overtime pay, the warehouse employee working an extra shift to fulfill online orders, and the ride-share driver without workplace protections. It's time for #UnionsForAll.
Thanksgiving is an opportunity for Americans to come together—as families, friends, and as a nation. 

Today I'm especially thankful for the sacrifices of those in uniform—protecting us abroad so that we may celebrate at home.

From my family to yours, happy Thanksgiving.
Today, as we travel to be with family or friends or begin to set the table for Thanksgiving dinner, let’s focus on the values we share and the hopes we carry to build a better future for our families, our communities, and our country. https://t.co/fPRdc0p1zC
If we are going to defeat Donald Trump, we need a nominee who can credibly call out his corruption. That's why I've released my tax returns in both the public and private sectors. Any candidate who claims they can beat Trump should lead by example. https://t.co/Fju2ZIAjQ9
Today, I’m announcing a comprehensive plan to usher in a new era for older Americans. One that empowers them to age and retire with dignity—while equipping them and their families with a sense of security over their futures. https://t.co/eGBuI9MnuB
This president is robbing our nation of its values and our service members of their honor.
https://t.co/H9LKe0wo7S
@TheRevAl Thank you for having me, @TheRevAl, and for the important work you and the @NationalAction team do every day.
Donald Trump has been repeatedly manipulated by our adversaries. He has allowed them to purchase the silence of the American president.

As I just told @JakeTapper, that will not happen when I am in office. https://t.co/hUc9UxOiht
I applaud the bravery of the Iranian protestors and I stand with them as they once again rise up to demand change. The Iranian government must take action to improve the lives of its citizens, rather than resorting to violence and censorship to repress protests.
Thank you for the warm welcome, Atlanta. Appreciated the opportunity to share what’s in my heart and to hear from Georgians this morning about the issues most important to them and their families. https://t.co/6qc5qBITC1
Thank you @FairFightAction for having me at your Atlanta office today, and for your leadership on voting rights. We must work together to fight voter suppression and keep every voter on the rolls. https://t.co/Xt6YSX3okB
@PeteForAmerica @Snapchat @instagram I just stepped off the #DemDebate stage. If you’re with me, please chip in and let’s keep going: https://t.co/rYoEiIdhiR https://t.co/JITBsd6FwS
I’m not only running to defeat Donald Trump, I’m running to launch the era that must come next. I’m inviting progressives, moderates, and future former Republicans to join us in building that era—an era characterized by belonging, not by exclusion. #DemDebate https://t.co/vYeP1nkWbg
Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we as a country? #DemDebate https://t.co/TtXszfuhHS
As a mayor who has seen the consequences of systemic racism on my neighbors, as a person whose faith teaches me to stand with the marginalized, and as someone whose rights have been expanded by people who are like me and not like me, I'm determined to get this right. #DemDebate https://t.co/zWxXmQYLzY
We need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century. #DemDebate https://t.co/bf2DlGdGks
We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president. After all, he’s relying on 17th century defense mechanisms, like building a wall. As president, I will focus on the threats of the future. #DemDebate https://t.co/vuNchP1mAN
This president doesn’t care one bit about farmers. #DemDebate https://t.co/n0Jg68ZJY5
Whether it’s his trade war or small-refinery waivers, this president keeps asking farmers to take one for the team. As president, I will recruit farmers and rural Americans to help solve our nation’s greatest challenges. #DemDebate https://t.co/YrNxx3UJ5s
What we do to better lives in a Midwestern town might look small to Washington politicians. But where I’m from, it’s the partisan fighting in Washington that looks small. #DemDebate https://t.co/GJdp60aEVd
We have an opportunity to make real progress on health care, gun safety, and immigration. But only if we galvanize—not polarize—the American people. #DemDebate https://t.co/7I6czaDZsy
We must confront Donald Trump for his wrongdoings. That means impeachment. But we must do more. I’m running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble of his presidency, pick up the pieces, and unify a divided nation. #DemDebate https://t.co/vdjUf567QI
I’m about to take the #DemDebate stage. 

My team in South Bend will tweet for me while I’m out there, so follow along here and at @PeteForAmerica. I hear we've also got plans for @Snapchat and @Instagram, so stay tuned. Here we go.
We launched @PeteForAmerica with little more than hope in our hearts and bold ideas for a better future. Since then, nearly 700,000 Americans have invested in our campaign for change. You've gotten us here. I am profoundly grateful and I hope I make you proud tonight.
Focused. https://t.co/timse9YAWK
This election will be the fight of our lives. But after that fight ends, the real work begins. 

I’m running to be the president who will stand amid the rubble, gather up the pieces of our divided nation, and lead us toward a better future. https://t.co/VAjKy7vqkE
Proud of Hoosier teachers and allies for their massive show of support for public education today in Indiana. When we better honor and compensate our educators, the future will be brighter for all Americans. #RedForEd https://t.co/L8yxkpYOUC
At least 22 transgender and gender non-conforming people have been killed in America this year. Tonight, I’m thinking of them and those whose deaths may never be reported. We must all commit to building a country where transgender Americans are safe, equal, and free. https://t.co/mUfDdBLWCD
Latinas in America earn just 54 cents on the dollar. That’s not enough to invest in an education, provide for a family, or achieve the American Dream. As we recognize tomorrow’s #LatinaEqualPayDay, we must acknowledge our duty to ensure an economy that works for everyone.
Instead of providing free college tuition for the children of millionaires and billionaires, I will open doors of opportunity for Americans who choose not to go to college with massive investments in apprenticeships, workforce training, and lifelong learning programs.
As president, I will strengthen paths to college for students from working and middle-class families with historic investments in HBCUs, expanded Pell Grants, and tuition-free public college: https://t.co/wzkiqlSgch https://t.co/pihZRX11Gq
Like his service, Lt. Col Vindman’s testimony demonstrates not just courage but real love for our country and its freedoms. 

Now, the character of our country is on the line.
There will come a day when Donald Trump is no longer in office.

I am running to be the president who can stand on the rubble, pick up the pieces of our divided nation, and guide us toward a better future—united as one United States of America. https://t.co/jC4YoqGcG7
The Trump administration’s statement on West Bank settlements is not only a significant step backward in our efforts to achieve a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is the latest in a pattern of destructive decisions that harm our national interests. https://t.co/1RFBv7O1bZ
Cost should never be a barrier to a brighter future for anyone in our country—whether someone chooses to go to college or not. The plan I'm unveiling today makes affordable college and workforce programs available to all. https://t.co/WpIP9sU8oq
Our future will be shaped in many ways by the education we make available to all Americans—whether they choose to go to college or not. Today, I’m proud to announce a plan to open new horizons by bringing opportunity within reach: https://t.co/A2GZkxReg9 https://t.co/fhjhOxz55I
China is waging a shocking, merciless campaign to erase the religious and ethnic identity of millions. The United States has a responsibility to speak out. This president’s silence has a cost. https://t.co/y7tPxKhBjN

Chief Justice Mark Cady’s rulings changed lives, making more Americans more free and bringing hope to many. His service set an example for the nation, and I am profoundly grateful. My deepest condolences are with the Cady family, his community, and the people of Iowa. https://t.co/sBAFP8isZK
There’s nothing pro-military about overruling our military justice system to prevent it from delivering accountability for war crimes. The president has again dishonored our armed services.
Encouraged by today's news out of Texas. Governor Abbott should accept this recommendation and give Rodney Reed the new trial he deserves and justice demands.
https://t.co/lyh4XnYqmW
Amb. Yovanovitch is a profile in patriotism and courage. All Americans owe a debt of gratitude to her and the career diplomats and public servants who serve with honor and now find themselves under a spotlight they didn’t seek. For them, the national interest always comes first.
This isn't just about this president. It's about the presidency. It's about the future of our republic. https://t.co/jgUbxOJ2vs
@AdyBarkan @rachael_scar Congratulations, Ady and Rachael, on welcoming Willow into your family! We’re thrilled for you and all of us at @PeteForAmerica are sending our best.
A 16-year-old girl.

A 14-year-old boy.

My heart breaks for their families, the Santa Clarita community, and our country. America is sacrificing a generation to the devastating effects of gun violence because our leaders in Washington lack the will to save lives. We must act.
I will be a commander in chief who keeps America’s promise to those who kept their promise to serve our nation. https://t.co/zUpHJuve0L
We don’t yet have all the details of the horrifying events in Santa Clarita. But we do know that in America today, children are scared to go to school. Parents and teachers are terrified. And that can’t stand. It is time to hold the NRA and our leaders in Washington accountable.
Left without remedy, an injustice does not heal. It compounds. As president, I’ll increase funding for HBCUs and minority-serving institutions by $50 billion, because we have a national obligation to invest in the next generation of Black American leaders.

I’m proud to stand with @MaryKayHenry and @SEIU workers in the #FightFor15. It is time for #UnionsForAll. https://t.co/sJF9n87jr9
I strongly condemn the rocket attacks on the citizens of southern and central Israel. Israel has a right to defend itself against acts of terror that set back any progress towards peace and will only serve to inflame the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

Today, Sikhs worldwide are celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. Sikh Americans have made our nation stronger, and I hope you will join me in wishing our Sikh friends and neighbors a joyful celebration.
@CityofSouthBend Thanks to our crews for keeping South Bend streets safe to drive—and thanks to residents for your patience and understanding as leaf crews and trucks temporarily switch over for snow duty!
I appreciate this reporter’s swift and honest correction of a misquote on my views of the Obama presidency. From health care to DADT repeal to the rescue of the auto industry, my appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place. https://t.co/eWvSDtcpTQ
This Veterans Day, we pause to honor the courage and sacrifice of all those who've stepped up to serve. Let us also reflect on the promises our country must make to them in return. Fellow veterans, I am proud to stand with you: https://t.co/WAR4khZphL https://t.co/xvHqHww4Rk

This week, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a crucial case for DREAMers across our country. If you or someone you know is a DACA holder, please know that I am with you. You belong.

Fellow veterans take note: the President of the United States has formally confessed to illegally misdirecting charitable funds from an event he claimed was a benefit for veterans. How many more affronts to flag and uniform will we tolerate? https://t.co/ZyvEYoBV8D
Rodney Reed is set to be executed on November 20th in Texas—despite new evidence that could prove his innocence. For justice to be served, the truth should be out. Rodney Reed deserves a new trial. If you live in Texas, call Governor Abbott to demand one: 512-686-5729
The death penalty in America is not only a cruel practice, it furthers systemic racism and has taken too many Black lives. It cannot deliver equal or true justice—it's time for it to end. For proof, we need to look no further than the case of Rodney Reed. https://t.co/0vVoWsnq6x
We need an economy that delivers more. As president, I won't just measure success by looking at the size of the stock market or GDP—I'll look to you. Today, I'm announcing a plan to raise incomes, lower costs, and build a brighter future for all Americans. https://t.co/yEHC43el71
I respect the office of the presidency. But, as I just told @ChrisCuomo, this president has done nothing to command my respect—and I don’t believe he has done enough to command yours.

Voting is a right, not a privilege. I stand with New Hampshire college students, @ACLU_NH, and those who believe in democracy in the fight against HB 1264, a law intended to confuse and intimidate young citizens out of voting. All Americans deserve to have their rights protected.
Labor rights are under attack across the country. In Cedar Rapids, more than 500 @RWDSU workers are demanding fair wages and better working conditions from @GeneralMills. I am proud to stand with them and all workers in the fight for fair contracts and workplace protections.
From securing additional funding for schools to effectively combating New Hampshire’s substance use disorder crisis, Mayor Craig has addressed Manchester’s challenges head-on. We need more leaders like her—and it’s why she was re-elected. Congratulations, @JoyceCraigNH! https://t.co/gZwchoTrVB
There is no such thing as a permanently red state. Thank you to every organizer and supporter whose acts of hope made last night possible. You helped to elect @AndyBeshearKY in Kentucky and flip the Virginia legislature. Congratulations to Democrats across the country!
Big congratulations to James @MuellerforMayor and all of the South Bend Common Council members elected tonight! Great opportunities are ahead for continued progress and inclusive growth in our hometown.
Climate catastrophe is on the horizon—whether this president believes it or not. As president, I will restore American credibility and leadership by rejoining the #ParisAgreement and engaging the world to tackle climate as the global security issue of our time. We can’t wait.
This week marks the anniversaries of three of the deadliest mass shootings in American history: Fort Hood and Sutherland Springs, Texas; and Thousand Oaks, California.

Our calendars are filling up with reminders of Washington’s failure to keep us safe. It’s time for change.

Tonight, we’re back for #LJ19, our biggest Iowa event yet. I’ve got my family, those same friends, thousands of supporters by my side—and you. I am profoundly grateful to you, every @PeteForAmerica volunteer, and the more than 600,000 individual supporters who've gotten us here.
Nine months ago, a few friends and I arrived in Iowa for my first trip of this campaign. We started in Ames and finished right here in Des Moines, where I met with a few dozen folks for coffee. That trip—like many I've taken since—was an act of hope.
Running for office is an act of hope. I’m grateful to @BetoORourke for his leadership and for offering hope to Americans across our country. I know he will continue to fight for a safer and brighter future where all belong. https://t.co/hdueS7sfF1

This president took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. So did every member of Congress. This president violated that oath, betraying our country and leaving our representatives with no choice but to uphold their own. Congress must move forward with impeachment.
Today was one for the books. We're officially on the ballot in New Hampshire. Now let's go win. https://t.co/7tyZOawKbw
Digital platforms should accept their responsibility for truth in advertising, or they shouldn’t be in the business at all. If they run a political ad shown to be false, it should be removed—just like a TV station would do. We must act to protect our democracy in the digital age.
@NotifyLA My thoughts continue to be with all those in the paths of these life-threatening wildfires—from Easy to Getty to Kincade. Thank you to the firefighters and public servants working to keep California safe. We must act now to prevent climate catastrophe. https://t.co/Phz1L2fmUn
History will remember those who stood up to defend our republic, and the congressional Republicans who stood in their way.
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is an American patriot who should be honored for his courage—in a war zone and in a congressional hearing room. It's time for congressional Republicans to summon just an ounce of his courage by putting country ahead of party and supporting impeachment.
Seven years ago today, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in NY, claiming hundreds of lives and inflicting billions of dollars in damages.
