Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education.President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day. https://t.co/l1BIi9ffHmIt’s official — we’re on the ballot in New Hampshire.

Now Senate Republicans are refusing to reauthorize it. To all the advocates and survivors speaking out - your voice makes all the difference. It always has.

Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security.Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country.

Chip in to help us take back the White House: https://t.co/Z9v6FGZH0rI'm running for president to unite this country.

You are the backbone of America. https://t.co/GdCmhoKtT8Congratulations to Governor-Elect @AndyBeshearKY on his hard-earned victory. He has served the people of Kentucky well as attorney general — the Commonwealth is in good hands with him in the governor's office.Tonight, by voting in Democratic majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, Virginians sent a clear, powerful message that will resonate across this nation and shake the walls of the White House. https://t.co/78UbWLWX4hThe growing mountain of evidence makes one thing clear: We must impeach Donald Trump. https://t.co/bPhLx6N79ZI have fought for the Democratic Party my whole career.

As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program.Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness.The U.S. is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of the power of our example.
