Great news: U.S. graduate student Xiyue Wang has been released from Iranian custody, and two weeks ago the Taliban released American Kevin King. These are very positive developments. My thanks to everyone involved in these efforts.
78 years after the attack on Pearl Harbor, we still recall the amazing bravery and selflessness exhibited that day and over the next four years. We’re forever grateful.
I led a bipartisan letter to congressional appropriators urging them to fulfill the Navy’s request for funds to rebuild Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. It’s imperative to rebuild this base after it sustained significant damage from two major earthquakes this summer. https://t.co/8tPZbBxU8i
I’m glad to see the Voting Rights Advancement Act pass in the House today. We need to restore all protections in the original Voting Rights Act and prevent voter suppression across the country. It’s time for the Senate to pass the bill and #RestoreTheVote.

My thoughts are with the victims of two shootings at Navy bases this week in Pearl Harbor and Pensacola. My thanks to the first responders who risk their lives to save others.
I’m glad to see the Senate come together to pass the bipartisan FUTURE Act. Thanks to @SenDougJones for your leadership on this issue. California’s minority-serving institutions will benefit from the funding this bill provides. https://t.co/PYNOQs4Gsa
America is a generous country that should do more to help the most vulnerable, not less. Removing hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans from SNAP isn’t reflective of our values. https://t.co/EKnxbDTbmx
Our bill was included in the Senate-passed annual defense authorization. Military leaders have made commendable efforts to address the shortfalls of privatized housing, but it’s clear they need more tools to fix this problem.
In March, I introduced a bill to address the shortfalls of privatized military housing. It will ensure that all private military housing is up to code and give families the right to leave any home that is unsafe without fear of financial penalty. https://t.co/TrVOsFue1z
WATCH: The House Armed Services Committee is holding a hearing on the environmental hazards in private contractor-provided military housing. https://t.co/WhcsfJlK3q
Yesterday’s @SASCDems hearing reiterated that too many military families continue to live in dangerous conditions with little recourse to fix the problems. Our bill would help ensure private contractors provide clean, safe housing to our men and women in uniform. https://t.co/fS0gu41pOd
Sarah Pitlyk opposes fertility treatments and believes surrogacy has "grave effects on society." Read @SenDuckworth's powerful op-ed on what those extreme views would mean for families like hers and why the Senate must reject Pitlyk's judicial nomination. https://t.co/gC8gU5Qcz2
The Senate is about to vote on Sarah Pitlyk’s nomination to the federal judiciary. Pitlyk’s views on reproductive rights and her opposition to assisted reproduction are extreme and far outside the mainstream. I urge my colleagues to vote no.

I’m concerned about Sarah Pitlyk’s ability to fairly and impartially apply important reproductive rights precedents as a judge. She has spent the last two years focused entirely on opposing women’s reproductive rights, so I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose her nomination.
Sarah Pitlyk’s nomination to the Eastern District of Missouri is deeply troubling. She has defended blatantly unconstitutional abortion bans and supported the administration’s Title X gag rule, which has limited access to health care for low-income women. I will be voting no.
Everyone’s participation in the #2020Census is vital to ensuring our democracy works properly. From determining representation in Congress to distributing billions of taxpayer dollars back into our community, the census is one of the most basic forms of political participation.

It’s time to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. The bill we introduced in the Senate earlier this month has already passed the House 263-158 with 33 Republican yes votes. It’s not a partisan bill, it’s a survivors’ bill. https://t.co/fxi0j5dSYG

On the two-year anniversary of the Rancho Tehama shooting in Northern California, we suffered another shooting today in Santa Clarita. Senate Republicans should step aside and let Congress act. We must do more to stop this mass shooting epidemic.
The problem of high prescription drug costs is felt by too many families in our country.  This #WorldDiabetesDay, we must recommit to passing legislation that supports innovation but also ensures that lifesaving drugs are affordable to the patients who need it.
Earlier, I voted no on Steven Menashi’s nomination to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. He did not receive blue slips from either of his home state senators, and he has a history of poor legal advice. He shouldn’t be rewarded with a lifetime appointment to the bench. https://t.co/QMeoNe4b0W

Making VAWA stronger will help us reduce the tragic number of women who are victims of physical violence by a spouse, intimate partner or stalker during their lifetimes. Given the overwhelming House vote and the strength of the bill, the Senate needs to swiftly pass it.
However, this VAWA reauthorization isn’t a Democratic bill or a Republican bill. It’s a survivors’ bill, written by people on the front lines who are helping victims of violence each and every day.
We introduced the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act today because it’s a strong bill that protects women from abuse. The House already passed it 263 to 158 with 33 Republicans voting yes. There’s no reason that Senate Republicans shouldn’t also support the bill.

I’m thrilled that the Senate passed the PACT Act. I’ve long advocated for animal rights and this bill makes animal cruelty a federal crime, a much-needed step in the right direction. The president needs to swiftly sign this bill into law so abusers can be held accountable.
California is home to many minority-serving institutions that help expand higher education opportunities for people of all backgrounds. We must pass the bipartisan FUTURE Act immediately so we can renew funding that supports all minority-serving institutions.
A year after a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, Senate Republicans still refuse to act on commonsense gun legislation. This is an epidemic. We must act now.

I will work with Governor Newsom to look at all options to protect racehorses and increase transparency at racetracks. If the horse racing industry is unwilling to treat these magnificent creatures humanely, it has no business operating in the United States. https://t.co/39tSGre4A7
In the past, I’ve called for horse racing to be suspended at Santa Anita until it could ensure the safety of horses would be protected. With continued racetrack deaths, it’s clear that not enough has changed, so I renew that call.
It breaks my heart to hear that another horse died because of injuries sustained during the Breeders’ Cup at Santa Anita Racetrack. This year, 37 horses have died at Santa Anita, seven of those since racing resumed in September. That’s simply unacceptable.
Last week, I joined my colleagues in introducing a resolution calling for the U.S. to remain a signatory to this agreement. We must take bold steps to combat the climate crisis and withdrawing from the Paris agreement will only take us backwards.

Just because the Trump administration is ignoring its responsibility to address climate change, that doesn’t mean California will do the same. If the administration isn’t willing to help then it needs to get out of our way. https://t.co/uae9vkzZqH
My thoughts are with the family and friends of El Dorado County Sheriff’s Deputy Brian Ishmael. His death serves as an unfortunate reminder of the dangers that our law enforcement officers face on a daily basis. https://t.co/T4LwxLVPpJ
Today is the 4th anniversary of the Aliso Canyon gas leak, the worst gas leak in U.S. history. California needs to work toward a cleaner, safer energy system that doesn’t endanger the lives of families living near these facilities.
More than one billion Breast Cancer Research Stamps have been sold since its creation in 1998, raising nearly $90 million. In honor of #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth, I’m calling on retailers and banks to promote the sale of this important stamp. https://t.co/VQtF5V8BYJ
PG&amp;E has announced that power will be shut off for nearly 179,000 customers in Northern California. Counties that will be affected are Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Kern, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Mateo, Sierra, Sonoma, Tehama and Yuba. https://t.co/iMKur6mZRN
We’ve made great progress over the last couple decades toward a fully inclusive workforce, but there’s still much work left to do. During #NationalDisabilityEmploymentAwarenessMonth, we must continue to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to succeed in the workplace.
By deactivating 200+ accounts, Facebook showed that election interference continues to be a huge problem. With the 2020 elections just 12 months away, we must do more to identify &amp; eliminate foreign interference, protect voting infrastructure and uphold election confidence. https://t.co/idiqMXnCJj
PG&amp;E has announced more potential power shutoffs in Northern California this week due to high winds and wildfire risk. The latest information is available on their website here. Click on “check your address” to see if you might be affected. https://t.co/725TCnvcfK
Many people need the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to stay warm during the winter, but HHS has yet to release the necessary funds for the program. We’re calling on them to release the money now so no one has to choose between keeping the heat on or buying groceries. https://t.co/A4JGPBCDRX
Our NATO allies have stood by our side in conflicts around the world. We must strengthen and show our enduring support for this important alliance to promote international security, which is why I just voted to ratify North Macedonia’s accession to NATO.
We must continue to expand and strengthen the Affordable Care Act. Next year, prices are expected to drop &amp; the number of insurers will go up, further proving that the ACA works. We must protect this important legislation from President Trump’s repeated attempts to dismantle it. https://t.co/8CC09r9XnF
From determining representation in Congress to federal funding, the census is fundamental to our democracy. @SenKamalaHarris and I strongly urge every single individual living in California to participate in the 2020 Census and make sure their communities’ voices are heard. https://t.co/0pNxBnOZcz
The @LATimes Editorial Board gets it right. We can’t let Joshua Trees die out. We must address climate change NOW if we’re going to have any hope of saving the California desert’s iconic trees.

Great to see the USNS Miguel Keith christened today in San Diego. Congratulations to @GenDyn_NASSCO for completing construction of this Expeditionary Sea Base. https://t.co/DjANNdZDI9
This week I met with parents of victims from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland. I’ve heard stories like theirs far too many times. We need to enact commonsense gun safety legislation immediately so no other parents have to lose their children. https://t.co/jA7KWAc5UK
Nearly $90 million has been raised for breast cancer research since we created this stamp in 1998. Congress needs to pass our bipartisan reauthorization bill so we can continue to fund lifesaving research. #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth https://t.co/VQtF5V8BYJ
Yesterday I met with Hatice Cengiz, Jamal Khashoggi’s fiancée. It’s long past time to hold accountable the Saudi government and everyone involved in this murder. The administration must stand against such brutality and flagrant violations of human rights. https://t.co/xKWDCZzR5c
Studies are clear: we need to reinstate the assault weapons ban and get high-capacity magazines off our streets. When a shooter uses a high-capacity magazine they can fire more rounds without stopping, increasing the likelihood of mass carnage. We need to ban them now. https://t.co/d7wKB5JAi7
Early detection of breast cancer is key to survival. Access to affordable care helps women receive mammography services. Use this resource to see if you qualify for free breast cancer screenings. #NationalMammographyDay https://t.co/b8bq7z6k0T
Our country has to show compassion for patients like Maria Isabel Bueso. After hearing her story, I don’t know how anyone could lack the compassion necessary to help her stay. Today we introduced legislation to let her apply to stay here permanently. https://t.co/HrVtW0ycqa
On the 30th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake, we’re reminded of the dire toll earthquakes can have. We must continue to strengthen our infrastructure to minimize the damage of future earthquakes and ensure that we’re prepared for the next big one.
Our country has suffered a great loss. Elijah Cummings was here for two decades and he fought tirelessly for the people he represented. He was a man of conscience and we’ll miss his courage, his fairness and his talent. https://t.co/CjrDgSyHwe
The threat of a destructive earthquake is very real for California. During the annual “Great Shakeout” drill, practice makes perfect! Make sure you’re ready in case a real earthquake strikes. https://t.co/ho3sbtkWSd
Elijah Cummings was a champion for Baltimore and its residents, for Maryland and for our country. My thoughts go out to his friends, family and constituents, each of whom are suffering today. My everlasting thanks for everything he’s done for our nation.
Rose @Gottemoeller has had an AMAZING career in public service, most recently serving three years as NATO Deputy Secretary General. We’re so grateful for your lifetime of service. Good luck and best wishes as you join Stanford’s Freeman Spogli Institute.
I’m glad the House advanced the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act today. Teen e-cigarette use is an urgent public health crisis and we must act now. The House and Senate need to both move swiftly and pass the bill. https://t.co/V6R2LWeOBd
Congratulations to Dominique Evans of Clark Magnet High School and Gisele Ragusa of USC on receiving the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Math and Engineering Mentoring! California is lucky to be home to such great teachers.
The climate crisis poses a serious threat to the global food supply and food security. We must address climate change in a way that promotes sustainable food production and distribution. #WorldFoodDay https://t.co/kJuuoX0BkR
The Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria are our allies. Full stop. To abandon them in the face of Turkish aggression is shameful. I strongly support the bipartisan resolution that expresses support for the Kurds and calls on Turkey to immediately cease military operations in Syria. https://t.co/W6VO26IvZU
With reports that 300 wells throughout California are contaminated with toxic chemicals linked to cancer and other health issues, it’s clear the state and federal government, and in particular the Defense Department, must step up and address this problem. https://t.co/yr2D3ZeFil
Glad to see California staying at the forefront of the gun safety movement. Limiting gun purchases to one a month is common sense and will help reduce the number of weapons on our streets. https://t.co/hCAiC55TLc
Covered California open enrollment starts today! New financial help is available for 2020, so visit @CoveredCA to see if you’re eligible and compare health plans to find the one that works best for you. https://t.co/AVL94lk8OZ
I’ve worked with San Diego’s congressional delegation for years to improve water quality in the region and force Mexico to stop sewage from flowing across the border. We still have of work to do and this issue remains a top priority. https://t.co/BPIyITj0N0
