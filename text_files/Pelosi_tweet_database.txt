Read the timeline of Trump’s pressure campaign to get a foreign country to interfere in our elections. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/RnUxIbCvrCThe Courts have been clear again in the McGahn case: the President’s insistence that he is above the law is an offense to our Constitution and to every American. #DefendOurDemocracy 
https://t.co/TsNUWghceENo one is above the law, not even the President. #DefendOurDemocracy. https://t.co/fFfYVHKbiwAll freedom-loving people in the U.S. and around the world are inspired by yesterday’s historic vote in #HongKong! The people of Hong Kong cast their resounding vote for democratic freedoms and autonomy, which must be fully respected by Beijing.Reports that more than 100 protestors have been killed by Iranian security forces raise serious concerns. All Iranians should be able to make their voices heard without fear of reprisal. Iran must immediately restore full internet access and allow all to speak out.Whether calling on @SenateMajLdr McConnell to finally call a vote on life-saving legislation to #EndGunViolence or hearing from young immigration activists, we will never give up our fight #ForThePeople. Here are a few moments that stood out. https://t.co/uOrN7VthNRThe people of #HongKong deserve a future that sees their rights respected.

“The US has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say it’s reciprocal.”

“I would like you to do us a favor though.”

Read our letter: https://t.co/bqnDle8x6V https://t.co/euYgbTrH2qHere’s a description of President Trump’s pressure campaign against Ukraine, from somebody who was a part of it: “it kept getting more insidious” https://t.co/bczY9oIIxw https://t.co/d470kFWm8mThe Trump Admin’s proposed rule allowing @HHSgov grant recipients to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans using taxpayer funds is shameful.

If I was concerned about things being easy, I never would have come to Congress in the first place.

#DefendOurDemocracy #LSSC https://t.co/cSMn7Y8OLTOur investigation into the President’s betrayal of his oath of office is based on a simple question: is it acceptable for a president to pressure a foreign government to undermine our elections for his political gain? #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/2c9RAT0t8fThe American people don’t need a grim reaper.
 
They need leaders who will #EndGunViolence, #SaveTheNet, and reinstate the protections found in #VAWA.
 
It’s time for Senate Republicans to get to work.

I’m sure a little encouragement from the President wouldn’t hurt.The House has already passed these and many more, with passage of H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, coming soon as well. And yet Mitch McConnell wants to brag to his donors that he is the “Grim Reaper” instead of passing them.H.R. 582 would #RaiseTheWage for workers across the country – reinvigorating the middle class &amp; strengthening our economy.
 
By passing the #ClimateActionNow Act, we will confront the Climate Crisis, something young people around the world are rightly demanding.Some key examples?
 
H.R. 7, the #PaycheckFairness Act, would ensure equal pay for women nationwide.
 
Meanwhile, the #ForThePeople Act would enact the most ambitious set of democracy reforms and ethics standards in a generation.@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The scores of bills we’ve passed aren’t busy work.
 
If passed into law, they will improve the lives of Americans across the country &amp; build a better future for generations to come.
 
But the @SenateGOP has made the cynical decision to ignore it all..@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Washington want you to think Democrats can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.
 
But we’ve been fighting #ForThePeople since Day One.
 
The House-passed legislation piling up outside @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office proves it. https://t.co/vgb0QajcaWLast month, the President walked away from our Kurdish allies in Syria. Now, Chairman Eliot Engel is leading the bipartisan fight to support our allies &amp; establish a concrete plan to defeat ISIS. https://t.co/1P279tdN7kIt has been 246 days since @HouseDemocrats passed legislation to #EndGunViolence.
 
@realDonaldTrump needs to stop looking for excuses and work with us to end the cycle of violence &amp; save lives. https://t.co/Fo4JONJOvdThe start of the 2020 open enrollment period means that millions of Americans can once again access quality, affordable health care coverage for themselves and their families.

Dems will keep fighting the GOP's anti-science agenda &amp; urging Senate to pass #ClimateActionNow.We’ve learned so much about Trump’s months-long campaign to pressure Ukraine because military veterans &amp; his own national security aides stood up to tell the truth. They put their country ahead of everything else. It’s not too late for Republicans in Congress to do the same.Too often, the tragic reality of the Armenian Genocide has been denied. Today, an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the House ensured that the truth will forever be etched into the Congressional Record. https://t.co/9NE5XZyK3oThe House will vote on Thursday to move forward on open hearings as we set out the process for the next phase of our inquiry.

My prayers are with his wife, Monica, their sons John and Carl, and the entire Conyers family at this time. https://t.co/WWqVZNG6DaThe House has been following the facts and the evidence has only made the President’s own words on his call more appalling.

Called the Constitutional ban on profiting off the presidency “phony”

Given blanket defiance of lawful subpoenas

Stood by his shakedown of a foreign power as “perfect”

He insists he is above the law. We are following the facts. #TruthExposedWhat the @HouseGOP fears the most is the truth. Instead of discussing the facts, they choose to attack @RepAdamSchiff.

To be clear: Rep. Schiff is a great patriot. America is well-served by his strategic leadership. https://t.co/iS1SoIVCPsWe are sad about losing two of Baltimore’s great leaders, Elijah Cummings and Tommy D’Alesandro.

But President Trump’s:

Reversing sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America’s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike.For 47 years, the #CleanWaterAct has safeguarded our children’s clean water. But since Day One, the Trump Admin has given big special interests free rein to poison our communities &amp; threaten families' health. @HouseDemocrats are ending this corruption &amp; fighting #ForThePeople.When Chairman Elijah Cummings spoke, America listened. He pushed each and every one of his colleagues to work for a higher purpose. May we all seek to follow his example. https://t.co/pYgeNqpvkoThe Constitution is clear: the President cannot accept gifts or payments from foreign governments. No one is above the law. #EmolumentsClause https://t.co/bHEx2qI2D330 years after the devastation of the #LomaPrieta earthquake, San Franciscans remember the loved ones we lost, the courage of our first responders and the determination &amp; spirit to repair and rebuild – rising stronger than ever. https://t.co/MvUcjU6NAF https://t.co/jfCe2zB6ilThe House has lost our North Star. Chairman Elijah Cummings was a leader of towering character &amp; integrity. His wisdom, his warm friendship and his great humanity will be deeply missed. Rest in peace, my friend. https://t.co/WP0830KCkV https://t.co/Hx8RFIWFPCIt is a privilege to welcome President Sergio #Mattarella of Italy to the U.S. Capitol to discuss the deep ties between our countries. https://t.co/k2zZcvKVTBI am speaking with reporters live from the U.S. Capitol as the Congress mourns the loss of @OversightDems Chairman Elijah Cummings. https://t.co/5VvDKV6pq8I will be holding my weekly press conference at 10:45 am ET.

Tune in here to watch: https://t.co/rFd2fqW3QvIt was my pleasure to congratulate my friend, Speaker John Bercow, for his well-deserved @PinkNews award in recognition of his steadfast work to advance the rights of the LGBTQ community in the UK. Congrats, Mr. Speaker! https://t.co/GH8nU2eDBOI am deeply concerned that the White House has canceled an all-Member classified briefing on the dangerous situation the President has caused in Syria, denying the Congress its right to be informed as it makes decisions about our national security.California: Health Care Open Enrollment is now here.

Our Republican colleagues should end their stunts, consult their oaths, and answer this simple question honestly to the American people: is it acceptable for the President to ask a foreign country to investigate his political rivals? #TruthExposed https://t.co/6VFx7bE4xHThe #LowerDrugCosts Now Act will improve financial opportunity for families &amp; save lives across America by reining in out-of-control drug prices. #ForThePeopleAmerican seniors &amp; families shouldn’t be forced to pay more for their medications than people in other countries. @HouseDemocrats are committed to passing H.R. 3 to #LowerDrugCosts nationwide. https://t.co/r9NBGgnpbU.@HouseDemocrats are coming together at 11:30 am ET to highlight the ongoing fight to #LowerDrugCosts for seniors &amp; families across the country. https://t.co/rFd2fqW3QvOn one side, you have a repressive regime crushing democratic freedoms in #HongKong. On the other, you have young people speaking out for freedom &amp; democratic reforms. Proud to stand with @RepMcGovern in support of today’s bipartisan votes showing the House’s commitment to HK. https://t.co/fmwA6KkR7bI am taking questions from reporters following a meeting of @HouseDemocrats. #TruthExposed https://t.co/WgJeVUWjO1I will be taking questions from reporters tonight at 6:30 pm ET following @HouseDemocrats’ Caucus meeting. #TruthExposed https://t.co/rFd2fqW3QvEvery time we meet with students &amp; families, we hear the same thing: college is far from being affordable. Now we are putting an end to years of Republican inaction by introducing the #CollegeAffordabilityAct. https://t.co/95Yar7WFEjToday, @HouseDemocrats are unveiling the #CollegeAffordabilityAct to protect students &amp; families across the country and put money back in their pockets. Thank you to @RepBobbyScott, whose relentless leadership has made this historic day possible. https://t.co/tSgg8j7QkSOver 44 million Americans are struggling with $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. Today, @HouseDemocrats are introducing the #CollegeAffordabilityAct at 3:30 pm ET. https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv.@realDonaldTrump’s newly-announced sanctions against Turkey fall very short of reversing the humanitarian disaster brought about by his own erratic decision-making. https://t.co/MMvt0S9Tl6We can save billions by finally negotiating for #LowerDrugCosts. And that’s just the beginning: H.R. 3 would extend those lower prices to Americans across the country. https://t.co/evDporagP8As we find ourselves in a situation where the President gave a green light to the Turks to bomb and effectively unleashed ISIS, we must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting.Next, we must put together the strongest bipartisan, bicameral sanctions package similar to the bipartisan bill the House is advancing.Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President’s dangerous decision in Syria immediately.The departure of the Acting Homeland Security Secretary is the latest sign of this Administration’s failed leadership, which has worsened the humanitarian situation at the border, and injected pain and tragedy into countless lives. https://t.co/XvIERZL1qFWhen we have the power to negotiate for fair drug prices, we put money back into the pockets of seniors &amp; families, reduce insurance premiums, &amp; improve the personal and financial health of the American people. #LowerDrugCosts https://t.co/DB9TCQT3XiMEDIA ALERT: They’ve found Mr. Ghirardelli, Ben and Jerry, and Grandmother See from See’s Candies! 🍫 https://t.co/NrPdDK1mPzEveryone’s story is different, and everyone’s story matters. #ComingOutDay https://t.co/tcsqkWitAn
