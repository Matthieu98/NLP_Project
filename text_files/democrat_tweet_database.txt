Governor Northam, you have the opportunity to empower unions and working families. You should take it. https://t.co/laaNjR2yzb
I'm so grateful for Amber Torres's support and I will fight to ensure the United States meets its trust and treaty obligations. https://t.co/t50J8ixOIe
This is cruel and appalling. These students simply dreamed of getting the high-quality higher education America can offer. ICE deceived and entrapped them, just to deport them. https://t.co/t6kQLiV5oh
I'm proud to stand alongside @Deb4CongressNM in the fight to ensure that the United States honors its promises and commitments to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples. https://t.co/qjTZybxL37
At its best, America is a place for big dreams and second chances. That’s what I’ve always fought for, and that’s the America I want us to build together. https://t.co/j42UClCodh
The Trump administration's cruel and dangerous policies are putting children in danger and driving families apart. When I'm president, I'll end his racist policies and welcome immigrants and asylum seekers. https://t.co/Sm91Xp9nCl
Presidential candidates typically do "call time"—also known as calling wealthy donors and asking for big checks.

Not me. Our campaign is funded by grassroots donors like you. Will you pitch in now? https://t.co/1tDuvv0GYu
Google recently hired a notorious union-busting firm—and yesterday, fired four employees who were organizing their colleagues and holding Google accountable. I stand with Rebecca Rivers and her colleagues. I’ll always fight to protect workers’ rights. https://t.co/dUIsEd58jY
Monopolies are bad for consumers and our economy—and they're bad for employees, too.

But when workers build a grassroots movement and fight together to hold Big Tech companies like Amazon accountable, they can win. https://t.co/XQ1Iku6zpp
Dream big, fight hard, put on your sweatshirt, and let’s get to work! https://t.co/JP6wo9OkNp
Yup, I’m tired of “Woe Is Me” billionaires too, @TrevorNoah. My #WealthTax will help families afford child care, college, and free an entire generation from student loan debt—and the billionaires will be just fine. https://t.co/JrkfTPqkt8
Some billionaires figured it might be cheaper to run for president than pay my #WealthTax. Well they don’t have the power of a grassroots movement—and in our democracy, I believe in the power of people over money. https://t.co/tDo1Rjg4WM
Fighting for the #GreenNewDeal isn't just about fighting climate change. It's a commitment to building a better future for the working people of our country by creating millions of good union jobs. We can’t fight climate change with a low-wage economy.
We need to build a new farm economy that is truly open to all. I’ve listened to Black farmers and updated my plan to reflect their experiences. We must root out structural racism to ensure Black farmers succeed. https://t.co/Y9AUKDxHDy
We need bold action now to pass the #GreenNewDeal, build a green new economy, and defeat the climate crisis—and I've got a plan for that. I'm proud to work alongside groups like @SunriseMvmt to build the grassroots movement we need to fight climate change. https://t.co/GHJKDCloow
After my daddy's heart attack, he couldn't work for a while. So my mother got a minimum wage job—and that job saved our house. She was scared, but she found the strength to do what needed to be done to save our family. https://t.co/oeMFWT4Jq5
I’ve got a lot of plans to bring big, structural change to Washington. But first, there's one plan that makes it all possible: Making sure we hit our monthly fundraising goals.

Can I count on you to pitch in to our grassroots movement before midnight? https://t.co/W0M93uwDUU
Private companies shouldn't be able to profit off of incarcerated people by charging them to read a book or video call their family. My plan for criminal justice reform will rein in this exploitation. https://t.co/WY2oZ41229
I've proposed the biggest and most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly half a century—an immediate $200 monthly increase. Families need financial security.

Michael Bloomberg may think he doesn't need people to win this election—he just needs bags of money.

He’s wrong. That's why I'm investing in meeting thousands of voters, taking over 85,000 selfies, and building a grassroots movement that will fight for big, structural change. https://t.co/DZftlFvyqi
Experts agree: Broad student debt cancellation would supercharge economic growth by freeing a generation crushed by debt. Candidates who oppose it should explain why punishing young people matters more than promoting home ownership and business creation. https://t.co/9UUPYUYWYE

For months, the people of Hong Kong have taken to the streets to stand up for their rights. This weekend, they went to the ballot box and sent the powerful message that they want to keep their democracy—and Beijing must respect that. https://t.co/tEvUKsz0zu
Let’s be clear: Our government criminalizes too many things and sends too many people to jail. In a Warren administration, we will: 

☑️ Repeal the 1994 Crime Bill 
☑️ Legalize marijuana
☑️ Undo the legacy of the War on Drugs
☑️ End cash bail and private prisons
History has proven that when working women fight together, they win. The Black women of the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike show the true story of American persistence. https://t.co/9ht7ophMNx
There have been 2,302 mass shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook. We shouldn't have to live like this. But unless we root out corruption in Washington, the gun lobby will always have a veto on any legislation to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/QPx0DtRGIA
I support the students, organizers, and activists demanding accountability on climate action and more at #HarvardYale. Climate change is an existential threat, and we must take bold action to fight this crisis. https://t.co/lm1V6honI4

This guy was Mick Mulvaney’s right-hand man in Congress. Now, he has a plum job as a payday loan lobbyist and is cozying up to Mulvaney to advance his clients’ interests.

@maddygunawan It was great meeting you, Maddy. Thanks for being in this fight!
Mike Bloomberg is placing $34 million in TV ads in one week—the most of any presidential candidate in history.

That’s one way to pay less under my #WealthTax. Because in a Warren administration, he and his billionaire friends would finally have to pay their fair share. https://t.co/qWHtk37zaM
I’m grateful to have you in this fight, @bjoewolf. Together, we’ll keep fighting to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/eCDVw2Pcys
Unlike other candidates, I don’t host fancy fundraisers, I don’t take money from PACs, and I don’t cozy up to billionaires.

Instead, small-dollar donors are the backbone of our grassroots campaign. Donate whatever you can now, and join the fight! https://t.co/EBLSASRJNB
Donald Trump is a walking, talking conflict of interest. It should be illegal for a president to twist the rules of our government to make themselves richer. Under my anti-corruption bill—the biggest since Watergate—it would be. https://t.co/icKIZvutSv

Let’s be clear: It’s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. We must be honest about our history, and do what’s right so that our nation can begin to heal. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Lsl47JezpM
White supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair. Now more than ever, all of us must embrace the lessons of Black history to confront this challenge. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/iPVwOk33HI
Racism props up the rich and powerful, leaving them free to take more power for themselves. And the rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. If we want power, we have to fight for it. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/owktsOca4G
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Yes, there’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.
@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.
@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.
@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!
@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.
@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.
@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.
@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.
@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.
@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.
@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.
@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?
@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.
@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf
@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.
@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.
@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.
@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.
@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!
@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”
@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.
@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.
@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.
@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.
@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.
@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU
@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.
I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we've fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarren
We're live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Tc7WIWuUuk
Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan.

Climate change is an existential threat—and unless we take urgent action to end this crisis, future generations will face catastrophic consequences. That's why I'm fighting for the #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/zZo5yT1dbP

Reproductive rights are economic rights. Reproductive rights are human rights. And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.
@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!
Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3S
The way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll.
Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34K
Awood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAru
I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that.
This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.
Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylC

To everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

I’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together. https://t.co/6Wir1mdB46
The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7A
I believe that abortion rights are human rights.

I believe that they're also economic rights.

And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. #DemDebate https://t.co/kDrlXSKr4Z
I’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebate
I just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlT
We have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebate
In my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3e
I’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It's time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9y
Abortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebate
When I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebate
Right now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebate
We need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here's what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:
✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k
✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools
✅ $50 billion in HBCUs
✅ Cancel student loan debt
#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqR

Billionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04h
Tens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.
I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.

My #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebate
Let me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:

✔️ Universal Child Care
✔️ Universal pre-k
✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools
✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs
✔️ Cancel student loan debt 

#DemDebate
My #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebate
The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebate
The Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That's what's happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebate
Today’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebate
Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. I stand with @StaceyAbrams—and that's why I have a plan to guarantee the right to vote and end voter suppression. https://t.co/wRvU1FR0yJ

From raising the federal minimum wage, to fighting systemic discrimination, to protecting Latina workers’ rights to unionize—I'm ready to fight on day one. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/54WDOq56co https://t.co/fgYdvNpscq
37 million Americans didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. 
36 million skipped a recommended test or treatment because of costs. 
40 million didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs.
This should never happen. It's time for #MedicareForAll.
On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we #SayTheirNames, and we re-commit to ending this epidemic. #TDoR https://t.co/6mTLM2grTq
I’m fighting my heart out for Rachael, for Carl, for baby Willow—and for you, @AdyBarkan.

(P.S. Willow: Your dad is an inspiration. I’m so honored to know him, and to fight alongside him for a better future for all.) https://t.co/PUqORwiJda
We wouldn't be this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without activists like @AdyBarkan, who has given his life to ensure that every American gets the medical care they need. I’m grateful down to my toes to be in this fight alongside you, Ady. https://t.co/jAo8dTcaAM
I’m deeply grateful to have your support in this fight, @AdyBarkan. I make this promise to you, to Willow, and to every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. 

We’re going to do this—side by side. Together. https://t.co/rS6PQvdNNB
White nationalist violence is a domestic terrorism threat—and we must treat it like one. I've got a plan to fight white nationalist violence. And when I'm president, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. https://t.co/AkO27jkySX
I'm standing with the Indiana teachers rallying for their schools. We need to invest in public education and our public school teachers. They're fighting for our students, so we should be fighting for them, too. #RedForEd https://t.co/QEzq5MwOlZ
We are facing a Black maternal mortality crisis in America. This is life and death for too many moms and babies. I've got a plan to end this epidemic. Thank you @NVPartnersLV and @StevenHorsford for welcoming me to the Black Community Summit. https://t.co/f6UpP3a1Iu
White nationalism has no place in our country, our White House, or our Congress. Let's start by getting Steve King out of office and electing @JDScholten to replace him. #IA04
I'm proud to fight alongside @AyannaPressley for the big, structural change we need—and so happy to announce that she'll be one of my special guests for my speech in Atlanta on Thursday! https://t.co/xbMgOhMCoS
From the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/AsdbVDKbsc
Our alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyv
I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2W
We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7f
Ultimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.
Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgv
I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bH
My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.
First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw
#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmf
Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6
Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.
Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.
I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.
Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.
Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.
Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.
We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.
But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.
Mother Emanuel AME Church.
Charlottesville.
Tree of Life Synagogue.
El Paso.
Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.
The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePg
Millions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I’ve got a plan to make housing more affordable, protect renters from unjust eviction and discrimination, and invest in healthy and green homes. 

Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to live. https://t.co/rWDJr8EXIF
The way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win! https://t.co/NyOX0QhIhs

The forceful removal of @NJWFA State Director @SueAltman from a public hearing is outrageous. I stand with her and @WorkingFamilies. https://t.co/DEaJiC6iQA
Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: "Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity." https://t.co/AZC9kpqoqx
Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv
Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization. https://t.co/CLBQLPfTsu
Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. Can’t wait to join them in Malaysia next month. https://t.co/jrure7D6Uv
Proud to see Oluwaseun @AyodejiOsowobi in this list. She’s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who’s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation. https://t.co/JSkUnRtaoD
Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt.
This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country https://t.co/rBAMNk0zvb
No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/aHHeNvAisn
Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm
Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.
Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. A true team with a spirit that’d do us all well.
Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm
.@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J
Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC.
Here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu
As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why. It’s a tribute to American leadership—and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you’ll read it. https://t.co/7iUWt76xUw
Like the Beatles said: It’s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! https://t.co/mImRqIYn1R

One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C
That’s what Americans do when others are in need – we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnRcAfNIk2
Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he’d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees.

Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hXu68RPH
As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9PVcwDl
Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs
Yesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaIt

Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/JG7Jgu4p9t

In America, we don’t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it’s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtG
#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. There, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better. https://t.co/fKgrVRiHhc

This generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world. So while this challenge is only getting more urgent, they show us the kind of action it'll take to meet this moment.
And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEI

Here’s a story about people doing good that's worth sharing: @BradPaisley and his wife @Kimwilliamspais saw food insecurity in Nashville and decided to do something about it. They just broke ground on a free grocery store to help families in need: https://t.co/o6pcAApZsm
Great to see Chicago’s historic mayoral race between two highly qualified candidates. Congrats to our next mayor, Lori Lightfoot—and Toni Preckwinkle campaigned hard and did us proud. I know that with our city’s heart and Lori’s leadership, Chicago’s best days are still ahead.
Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know “Finding My Voice” will inspire others to lift their voices, too. https://t.co/nWTBDByMoz
Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress—it's a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who’ve taken the torch. This group is going to be driving progress for a long time to come. https://t.co/W5dDlDtNzE

And here are some ways to help cyclone victims in Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe: https://t.co/if8HZBtWBH
The floods in the Midwest and in southern Africa are heartbreaking. Suffering and loss on two sides of the world calls for solidarity and strength from all of us. Ask what you can do to help our fellow Americans and families in need. Here are some ideas: https://t.co/jWJlKABqAb
In 2011, I visited the tiny town of Moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather Falmouth Kearney lived his early life. I'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the Irish people. Happy St. Patrick's Day! -Barack O’Bama https://t.co/abDtarFbR5
Michelle and I send our condolences to the people of New Zealand. We grieve with you and the Muslim community. All of us must stand against hatred in all its forms.
.@MichelleObama and I are rooting hard for Team USA as the Special Olympics World Games get underway this week. Our Special Olympians are terrific examples of America’s heart and drive.
What a great moment. Happy 110th, Virginia. https://t.co/FuNZV3RRV4
Michelle and I send our deepest sympathies to all who knew the victims of today’s plane crash in Ethiopia.
The Crew Dragon’s been on quite a ride since I last saw it—congrats to @NASA and @SpaceX on a successful return! We invested in the @Commercial_Crew program to strengthen the U.S. space program for the long haul, and it’s great to see that happening. https://t.co/Dsu5mZcaCZ
Preethi, Alice, and Sefora are just three of many @ObamaFoundation leaders who remind us what International Women’s Day is all about: imagining a world free of artificial ceilings for the next generation—and doing the hard work to get us there.
And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/cRb4EKcrvv
.@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she’s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. https://t.co/jNIiKIAZaO
.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the https://t.co/3RwHe5Razz Foundation, she’s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India—and beyond. https://t.co/TKuAKVL5Y1
On International Women’s Day, I’m reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. And I’m celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today.
It’s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair—everywhere—because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. Join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering: https://t.co/d7TYE8u0CD. https://t.co/rKchS3ltLI
Zion Williamson seems like an outstanding young man as well as an outstanding basketball player. Wishing him a speedy recovery.
I’m about to join @StephenCurry30 on stage with @MBK_Alliance to answer questions from boys and young men of color about the challenges that confront them and the opportunities within their grasp. Tune in at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4.
I’ve always loved basketball because it’s about building a team that’s equal to more than the sum of its parts. Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. https://t.co/lghcLaUN9a
Happy Valentine’s Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It’s true; she does get down to Motown. https://t.co/uypbZsEiqB
In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them.
Don’t be sad it’s over, be proud it taught us so much. Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.
Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.
My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: https://t.co/gjBYHHImzB
We lost two great Americans today – Frank Robinson and John Dingell – citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field.
As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson’s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. https://t.co/Fl9aDxqcGi
The @ObamaFoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what’s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. https://t.co/hFAMzW7tBq
I’ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life’s most persistent and urgent question: "What are you doing for others?" Let’s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.
I knew it way back then and I’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uC9J4
In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’ll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody!
I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9
Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ
Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd
Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO
As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I’m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year.
As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL
Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/LKLqlYfFUw
There’s no better time than the holidays to give back to your community. Yesterday I got to do just that at @ChildrensHealth. As we celebrate the season and look forward to 2019, let’s recommit to doing our part to build a world that is a little more generous, tolerant, and kind. https://t.co/77rcNoY8jn
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to the extraordinary kids, families, and staff at Children’s National. And thanks for humoring me as your stand-in Santa. https://t.co/mFmYCVk7cr
Today is the last day of open enrollment. That means it’s the deadline to make sure you and the people you love have health insurance in 2019. So head over to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod to get covered! Here’s what else you need to know today about health care: https://t.co/gosn6c6uCa
Joe is right. Head to https://t.co/SS87NTsgJt before tomorrow’s deadline. And nice bracelet, by the way. https://t.co/NFy3LxZe3f
As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/RMJgrWQhP2
No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I’m going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. https://t.co/8mHMsXGY0g
Happy Hanukkah! Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours.
America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight – and all who were inspired by George and Barbara’s example. https://t.co/g9OUPu2pjY
I am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be. Who understand that hope requires action. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/AbjXUwCh6z
Thanks to the Chicago @FoodDepository team for all you do and to the volunteers who are doing great work and let me crash today. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! https://t.co/r4QeBeCoT1
When someone shares their story, we see the world through their eyes. I’m looking forward to hearing a few from leaders around the world and sharing my own at the @ObamaFoundation Summit in Chicago. Tune in at https://t.co/GYkEOK8EuT. https://t.co/sOllDsDA1Z
Our future depends on all our young people, including our boys and young men of color, being able to achieve their dreams. Today, I’m proud to share @MBK_Alliance’s first investments in communities devoted to this mission. Get inspired: https://t.co/dKLWPvrFPC
Of course, @MichelleObama’s my wife, so I’m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise – one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE
Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who’s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who’ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk
To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend.
Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn
Today is the day. Today, it’s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. https://t.co/6xdMbKhwkr
If you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. Go vote! https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX
When you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance.
When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment – and make sure they’re paid equally.
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen.
Tomorrow’s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot.
Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP
Elections matter. You have the power to protect a family’s health care. Make a plan, grab some friends, and vote: https://t.co/rY8Ip1km9p
While we're talking about preexisting conditions, the ACA is the law that finally protected your coverage for preexisting conditions.

Those protections and your health care are absolutely at stake on Tuesday. Vote for Democrats who’ll protect them. https://t.co/BDDmY60u8k
Not sure who and what you can vote for? Head over to https://t.co/SHxg6ael0O to look up your state, learn who's running to represent you, which measures you can help decide, and more. Read up, and get ready to vote on November 6.
Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power — use it! In most states, you don't even have to wait until Election Day to cast a ballot. Find out where you can vote before Nov. 6: https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX https://t.co/hWkFHqi49K
We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.
The last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. More people go to Coachella. There’s no good excuse not to vote. Head over to https://t.co/zTCemnRMYV to check your registration, get your absentee ballot, and find out where to vote on November 6. https://t.co/LIQbltVJtz
America is always at our best when we look out for each other. Please do what you can to help people recover and rebuild from Hurricane Michael. https://t.co/psmPZnmlqY

Congratulations to Drew Brees on the all time passing record. Always a class act.
Happy Anniversary, @MichelleObama. For 26 years, you’ve been an extraordinary partner, someone who can always make me laugh, and my favorite person to see the world with. https://t.co/s8xoZ9j2YR
Today, I’m proud to endorse even more Democratic candidates who aren’t just running against something, but for something—to expand opportunity for all of us and to restore dignity, honor, and compassion to public service. They deserve your vote: https://t.co/NO5jnhX3XD
From civil servants to organizers, the young people I met in Amsterdam today are doing the hard work of change. And they keep at it for their communities, their countries, and the collective future of Europe and the world. Keep up the good work. https://t.co/AVtuBPHdr2
The antidote to government by a powerful few is government by the organized, energized many. This National Voter Registration Day, make sure you're registered, vote early if you can, or show up on November 6. This moment is too important to sit out.
The first class of Obama Fellows is full of leaders like Keith—hardworking, innovative, and dedicated to partnering with their communities to drive transformational change. https://t.co/FN794E7Cqs
We will always remember everyone we lost on 9/11, thank the first responders who keep us safe, and honor all who defend our country and the ideals that bind us together. There's nothing our resilience and resolve can’t overcome, and no act of terror can ever change who we are.
Today I’m at the University of Illinois to deliver a simple message to young people all over the country: You need to vote, because our democracy depends on it. I hope you'll tune in at 11am CT: https://t.co/34WjNaVAcU

Aretha helped define the American experience. In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade—our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect. May the Queen of Soul rest in eternal peace. https://t.co/bfASqKlLc5
Bobby Kennedy was one of my heroes. He was someone who showed us the power of acting on our ideals, the idea that any of us can be one of the “million different centers of energy and daring” that ultimately combine to change the world for the better. https://t.co/nAiPiGercs
I’m confident that, together, they’ll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes.
Today I’m proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates – leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent: https://t.co/gWzalQhFas
Mandela Day is about taking action to change the world for the better. In these young people, I see Madiba's example of persistence and hope. They are poised to make this world more peaceful, more prosperous, and more just. https://t.co/GJDuOs1hkH
This week, I’m traveling to Africa for the first time since I left office – a continent of wonderful diversity, thriving culture, and remarkable stories. As I prepare for this trip, I wanted to share a list of books that I’d recommend for summer reading: https://t.co/W4Jc0N23iy
San Francisco Mayor George Moscone &amp; Supervisor Harvey Milk embodied the optimistic, progressive vision of our city. 41 years after they were murdered in a shocking act of brutality, we will never stop advancing their mission to bring about a more caring, inclusive future.
These are the facts, and they are not contested. Read the timeline of Trump’s pressure campaign to get a foreign country to interfere in our elections. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/RnUxIbCvrC
The Courts have been clear again in the McGahn case: the President’s insistence that he is above the law is an offense to our Constitution and to every American. #DefendOurDemocracy

All freedom-loving people in the U.S. and around the world are inspired by yesterday’s historic vote in #HongKong! The people of Hong Kong cast their resounding vote for democratic freedoms and autonomy, which must be fully respected by Beijing.
Reports that more than 100 protestors have been killed by Iranian security forces raise serious concerns. All Iranians should be able to make their voices heard without fear of reprisal. Iran must immediately restore full internet access and allow all to speak out.
Whether calling on @SenateMajLdr McConnell to finally call a vote on life-saving legislation to #EndGunViolence or hearing from young immigration activists, we will never give up our fight #ForThePeople. Here are a few moments that stood out. https://t.co/uOrN7VthNR

“I would like you to do us a favor though.”

“There’s been a lot of talk about Biden’s son.”

Watch the witnesses at 9:00:

For Americans with diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life &amp; death.

When Members of Congress take the oath of office, we become custodians of the Constitution. We must uphold our duty to #DefendOurDemocracy.
We legislate. We investigate. We litigate. And yesterday, we had an important victory in our lawsuit to confirm Congress’s right to perform oversight, as the Court of Appeals ruled that the President’s financial records should be turned over to the Congress.
President Trump’s efforts to cover up his betrayal of his oath of office almost make the things Nixon did look small.
We are closely following updates regarding the school shooting in Santa Clarita. Thankful for courageous first responders working to save lives &amp; protect the community. What will it take for Republicans to stop blocking efforts to #EndGunViolence?

Republicans must stand up to @realDonaldTrump’s shameful attacks on America’s immigrant community. The Senate must finally #ProtectTheDream and pass H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act. https://t.co/p1dmZLjG28
Dreamers make America more American.

Tune in at 2:30 pm ET as House &amp; Senate Democrats come together to call on @SenateMajLdr McConnell to #ProtectTheDream and pass H.R. 6, the American Dream &amp; Promise Act. https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
Public servants across the political spectrum understand that it's not about politics to #DefendOurDemocracy. President Trump's pressure campaign was "out of bounds," and every time he insists that it was "perfect" he is saying that he is above the law. https://t.co/5MQMrfZ5fl
America’s veterans reflect the highest ideals of our country. They served our country – and now we honor their service by ensuring that no veteran is left behind when they return home. #VeteransDay https://t.co/LClOZJqlbx https://t.co/zbdusziomy
On November 9, 1989, the world watched as the people of Berlin tore down the wall that had separated families, friends &amp; a city for more than a generation. Today, we honor 30 years since their triumph &amp; call on world leaders to take heed of their example. #BerlinWall30
Our inquiry has uncovered some profound betrayals of our Constitution, but it has also uncovered acts of profound patriotism by public servants who stood up for what was right. We will continue to conduct our inquiry aspiring to the same ideals. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/MasXETk7yf
The President pressured a foreign country to smear his political opponents. Please read his words:

“The US has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say it’s reciprocal.”

“I would like you to do us a favor though.”

“There’s been a lot of talk about Biden’s son.” https://t.co/l4gNiodL6N
For more than 250 days, @SenateMajLdr McConnell has ignored House-passed legislation to #EndGunViolence.
 
It’s time for the President to join @SenSchumer &amp; I in calling for the @SenateGOP to finally take action to save lives.
 
Read our letter: https://t.co/bqnDle8x6V https://t.co/euYgbTrH2q
Here’s a description of President Trump’s pressure campaign against Ukraine, from somebody who was a part of it: “it kept getting more insidious” https://t.co/bczY9oIIxw https://t.co/d470kFWm8m
The Trump Admin’s proposed rule allowing @HHSgov grant recipients to discriminate against LGBTQ Americans using taxpayer funds is shameful. This is a perfect example of why we must make the #EqualityAct the law of the land. https://t.co/T5PqxIwCuV
A must read from @RepAdamSchiff:

"We now know that the call was just one piece of a larger operation to redirect our foreign policy to benefit Donald Trump’s personal and political interests, not the national interest.” #DefendOurDemocracy 

https://t.co/O5i8GM5pXe
Thank you to @RepMikeLevin for welcoming me to Oceanside today for a wonderful conversation about why America needs to see H.R. 1, the #ForThePeople Act, become the law of the land. https://t.co/89SYBK2ChV

Today, we see more of what witnesses have told the House inquiry. It was a months-long pressure campaign laying the groundwork for the President’s “do us a favor” call w/ Ukraine President Zelensky, contaminating our foreign policy for his political gain. https://t.co/mrUoSABbuV https://t.co/N3en72nLZL
Last week, the House voted to set up open hearings in the next stage of our inquiry into the President's betrayal of his oath. Meanwhile, our work #ForThePeople continues. Here’s a look at a few moments that stand out: https://t.co/rXGJzWZPLR
The most important thing to understand is that no one is above the law. #DefendOurDemocracy. #LSSC https://t.co/f0LMIMPso3
Let’s put it this way, @StephenAtHome:

If I was concerned about things being easy, I never would have come to Congress in the first place.

#DefendOurDemocracy #LSSC https://t.co/cSMn7Y8OLT
Our investigation into the President’s betrayal of his oath of office is based on a simple question: is it acceptable for a president to pressure a foreign government to undermine our elections for his political gain? #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/2c9RAT0t8f
The American people don’t need a grim reaper.
 
They need leaders who will #EndGunViolence, #SaveTheNet, and reinstate the protections found in #VAWA.
 
It’s time for Senate Republicans to get to work.

I’m sure a little encouragement from the President wouldn’t hurt.
The House has already passed these and many more, with passage of H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, coming soon as well. And yet Mitch McConnell wants to brag to his donors that he is the “Grim Reaper” instead of passing them.
H.R. 582 would #RaiseTheWage for workers across the country – reinvigorating the middle class &amp; strengthening our economy.
 
By passing the #ClimateActionNow Act, we will confront the Climate Crisis, something young people around the world are rightly demanding.
Some key examples?
 
H.R. 7, the #PaycheckFairness Act, would ensure equal pay for women nationwide.
 
Meanwhile, the #ForThePeople Act would enact the most ambitious set of democracy reforms and ethics standards in a generation.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The scores of bills we’ve passed aren’t busy work.
 
If passed into law, they will improve the lives of Americans across the country &amp; build a better future for generations to come.
 
But the @SenateGOP has made the cynical decision to ignore it all.
.@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Washington want you to think Democrats can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.
 
But we’ve been fighting #ForThePeople since Day One.
 
The House-passed legislation piling up outside @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office proves it. https://t.co/vgb0QajcaW
Last month, the President walked away from our Kurdish allies in Syria. Now, Chairman Eliot Engel is leading the bipartisan fight to support our allies &amp; establish a concrete plan to defeat ISIS. https://t.co/1P279tdN7k
It has been 246 days since @HouseDemocrats passed legislation to #EndGunViolence.
 
@realDonaldTrump needs to stop looking for excuses and work with us to end the cycle of violence &amp; save lives. https://t.co/Fo4JONJOvd

When we came to Congress, we all proudly raised our hands to support and defend the Constitution. That's what today's vote was about. In these open hearings we will seek the truth and ensure the American people can see it for themselves. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/LNv5fm4q79

The enduring bravery of firefighters, first responders, state leaders &amp; National Guard responding to fires across California reminds us of the urgent threat of the climate crisis.

Dems will keep fighting the GOP's anti-science agenda &amp; urging Senate to pass #ClimateActionNow.
We’ve learned so much about Trump’s months-long campaign to pressure Ukraine because military veterans &amp; his own national security aides stood up to tell the truth. They put their country ahead of everything else. It’s not too late for Republicans in Congress to do the same.
Too often, the tragic reality of the Armenian Genocide has been denied. Today, an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the House ensured that the truth will forever be etched into the Congressional Record. https://t.co/9NE5XZyK3o
The House will vote on Thursday to move forward on open hearings as we set out the process for the next phase of our inquiry. Americans will get to hear about the President’s abuse of power firsthand. I gather Republican Leaders do not actually want that after all. #TruthExposed https://t.co/tUeHeT6Ezj
Christine Darden, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan shattered barriers of race &amp; gender with their work on space exploration. It was a pleasure to sign legislation to formally recognize their inspiring contributions with a Congressional Gold Medal. https://t.co/tJ269lAidV
Singling out and banning @joshuawongcf from running in the upcoming District Council election is another blow against rule of law in Hong Kong and the principle of “One Country, Two Systems.”

The people of #HongKong should be able to choose their elected officials.
Today, @VetAffairsDems made progress for 2 million women veterans by advancing the bipartisan, bicameral Deborah Sampson Act to address the inequities at VA. Today’s poison pill amendments and GOP walkout are a shame. https://t.co/SJMvINNDgU
Everybody has read your words on the call. The Ukrainian President asks for military aid to fend off the Russian attack, you say “I want you to do us a favor though,” and then you spend the rest of the call asking for bogus investigations to smear your political opponents. https://t.co/vI2eD4T6vK
Grateful that Brandon Lee has returned home to SF for refuge and care after being brutally shot in the Philippines, where he was fighting for environmental and indigenous peoples’ rights. I have encouraged the Philippine government to investigate this disturbing crime.

Chairman John Conyers’ life was lived in service to achieving true equality in America. My prayers are with his wife, Monica, their sons John and Carl, and the entire Conyers family at this time. https://t.co/WWqVZNG6Da

The death of al-Baghdadi is significant, but it does not mean the death of ISIS. @realDonaldTrump must present the American people with a clear strategy to confront ISIS.

Given blanket defiance of lawful subpoenas

Stood by his shakedown of a foreign power as “perfect”

Yesterday, the House sent an overwhelming bipartisan message demanding a clear strategy to defeat ISIS, and the Senate should do the same immediately.
This sham ceasefire does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS from prisoners from escaping, and shows the President’s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS.
.@realDonaldTrump is flailing. Reversing sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America’s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike.
For 47 years, the #CleanWaterAct has safeguarded our children’s clean water. But since Day One, the Trump Admin has given big special interests free rein to poison our communities &amp; threaten families' health. @HouseDemocrats are ending this corruption &amp; fighting #ForThePeople.

Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President’s dangerous decision in Syria immediately.

.@MLB is proposing to cut 42 Minor League Baseball clubs.

The right to form a union is a constitutional right. Any corporation that engages in union busting or job outsourcing will not get a dime in federal contracts from a Sanders administration. Join me live in Salem, NH: https://t.co/FV1x6ol3wL
The wealth of the billionaire class is almost incomprehensible.

The Waltons get $70,000 richer every minute.

Jeff Bezos makes $2,489 a second.

That is why it is not radical to say that millions of people in this country should not be paid starvation wages.
If we could put people on the moon 50 years ago we sure as hell can make automatic voter registration possible nationwide.

Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We cannot stand by and watch that happen.
Health care is one of the biggest issues in this election. As president, I will ensure health care is a right, not a privilege — and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve. Read my full plan: https://t.co/ysfLJKi5xY
Climate change is an existential threat to our planet — we must take action. 

As president, not only will I recommit us to the Paris Agreement — I’ll lead the world to up the ante in addressing our climate emergency.

Thank you Tom and Christie Vilsack for your support. Together, we will win Iowa and move this country forward. https://t.co/zuZm2sdGvU
Our hearts go out to the families of Iranian protesters who were killed this past week. Iranians, like people everywhere, have a right to protest peacefully without being brutally attacked by their own government and having the internet shut down for days. The world is watching.
The Trump Administration’s “Infrastructure Weeks” are a joke — but our crumbling roads and bridges are not.

This election is about who we are and who we want to be. I believe we are a nation that welcomes those fleeing persecution and seeking asylum — not a nation that turns our back on them. https://t.co/qoVGCnGl21
Corruption is Donald Trump’s middle name.
We need to build an economy that reflects our values.

My administration will reverse the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations. We'll then use that money to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class.
Obamacare was and is a big deal. It saved lives and gave millions peace of mind. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over — we should protect and build on it. https://t.co/34NCSYzoUa
It’s clear that Donald Trump has abused the power of the presidency. Full stop.

He is the most corrupt president in modern American history.

We have to fundamentally change the culture of how women are treated in this country. #DemDebate https://t.co/bvrK6yPvcd
Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.

As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate

Over the last few days, there has been a lot of misinformation on where Joe Biden stands when it comes to our marijuana laws. Read the facts below. #DemDebate https://t.co/JEgMfuBgLQ

"It's the Attorney General of the United States — not the president's private attorney." #DemDebate https://t.co/30yUe3jgCd

Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate
Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant.
More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate
It’s not who we are. We are better than this. #DemDebate https://t.co/Gyo93iKomX
Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate
We are fired up and ready for Joe to take the stage at tonight’s #DemDebate! https://t.co/V0iGMuq3yu
Hey folks, it’s @TeamJoe here! We’ll be taking over Joe’s account tonight to keep you updated on all things #DemDebate. Grab some ice cream and follow along! https://t.co/uXTJmM0dJH

@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be.
I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level. https://t.co/1CAhAjKEju
I am deeply disturbed by the news coming out of my law school alma mater, Syracuse University. We are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/m6BNczblXY
On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear.
Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.

I’m inspired by the strength and resilience of Chrissy and survivors across the country, and proud of the change the Violence Against Women Act created, but we still have further to go.

China’s internment of nearly one million Uighur Muslims is among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today. The U.S. cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world. https://t.co/PQp04TWjyd
I’ve spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power. That’s what motivated me to write &amp; champion the Violence Against Women Act. The law helped change our culture—but there’s more work to do.

At the CNN Town Hall, I was asked what changes in American society I’m proudest of. Here’s what I had to say: https://t.co/X5OF6rwlJy
I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.

America is more equal because of Chief Justice Mark Cady.

This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism. https://t.co/qmyRbxGdiq

If you like your private health insurance plan, you shouldn’t be forced to give it up. If you don't like it, you should be able to buy into a Medicare-like public option.

That's the choice I will give Americans as president. https://t.co/sHkmn3mDxP
Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.

Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer.
President Trump campaigned on repairing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But after countless “Infrastructure Weeks,” he has failed to deliver results. It has to change.

Today, I'm calling for a transformational investment in our nation's future: https://t.co/mHG958ffo8
The Affordable Care Act
An assault weapons ban
The Violence Against Women Act

There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do. I know what it takes to get the job done.
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.

You shouldn't be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Under my plan, you will be able to keep them. https://t.co/lJZ9fvPWeV
This decision puts the health of the American people at risk — it’s unacceptable. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and choose science over fiction once again. https://t.co/YqVaGecPgQ
First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy.
We have to lead the world by our example and make clear that human rights, civil rights, and civil liberties matter to us. https://t.co/Ma26IxrInO

Change starts at the local level — I learned that firsthand as a 28-year-old on the New Castle County Council. On #NationalRunforOfficeDay, I'm asking you to join me and run for something. There is too much at stake in 2020 to sit on the sidelines. https://t.co/cEgKOoVhVI
President Trump's erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our national security and set our world on edge. Every day that he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States. https://t.co/QcUR5hVCdJ
Every worker should have the chance to join a union which bargains to ensure they get paid a living wage and have protections against sexual harassment. That's why I'm proud to stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking in Detroit and across the country today. https://t.co/r0y6uDM2na
Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist threats. It is intolerable that Israeli civilians live their lives under the constant fear of rocket attacks. That's why our administration was such a strong supporter of Israel's life-saving Iron Dome. https://t.co/aQOUdKZqq7

President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families. 

As president, I will meet our sacred obligation. https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.

Thank you to all who have served — on Veterans Day and every day. https://t.co/SQBUj8nwmw
I understand the sleepless nights, wondering if your deployed child is safe, and all the added sacrifices military families face because their loved one chose selfless service.

The ACA was, and is, a big deal. It took generations of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done.

Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them. https://t.co/jtOPJDnE30
My plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.

A fresh Fall day in New Hampshire spent serving chili to our nation’s finest — firefighters. https://t.co/9BRPyeDkLk
Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.
Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7
This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.
25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education.
President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day. https://t.co/l1BIi9ffHm

I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.

Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security.
Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House.

Congratulations to Governor-Elect @AndyBeshearKY on his hard-earned victory. He has served the people of Kentucky well as attorney general — the Commonwealth is in good hands with him in the governor's office.
Tonight, by voting in Democratic majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, Virginians sent a clear, powerful message that will resonate across this nation and shake the walls of the White House. https://t.co/78UbWLWX4h

Obamacare protects over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions — including Joe and Michelle’s son Matt. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it. https://t.co/yX6jDCg8fG
Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform.
Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on &amp; off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL &amp; @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program.
Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness.
The U.S. is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of the power of our example.

That’s what has always set us apart on the world stage, and that’s something Donald Trump will never understand. https://t.co/omaa5OTMc0

As the climate crisis worsens each day and California burns and Iowa floods, Trump continues to abandon science and our international leadership. He just notified the United Nations of our official withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. It's shameful. https://t.co/5UikQrsS3u
President Trump has turned his back on those he promised to help. He thinks he’s being tough with his trade war, but he’s really being reckless. And American workers are paying the price. 

I will ensure our policies put American workers first. https://t.co/oui5atVxXl
A country that ignores the threat to the very survival of this planet isn’t just troubled — it’s morally bankrupt.

We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and take urgent action to address the climate emergency.
Is anyone surprised that all it takes is a $100 saw to breach Trump’s wall? This whole exercise was a stunt and a sham from the beginning. The only thing the wall has succeeded in doing is tarnishing the image of our nation in the eyes of the world. https://t.co/9d8lNoCEth
This is a dangerous decision by the Trump Administration. We should be strengthening our clean water protections and holding polluters accountable for their actions — not loosening restrictions on toxic waste. https://t.co/asV8E9gCLb

Yup, I’m tired of “Woe Is Me” billionaires too, @TrevorNoah. My #WealthTax will help families afford child care, college, and free an entire generation from student loan debt—and the billionaires will be just fine. https://t.co/JrkfTPqkt8

Fighting for the #GreenNewDeal isn't just about fighting climate change. It's a commitment to building a better future for the working people of our country by creating millions of good union jobs. We can’t fight climate change with a low-wage economy.
We need to build a new farm economy that is truly open to all. I’ve listened to Black farmers and updated my plan to reflect their experiences. We must root out structural racism to ensure Black farmers succeed. https://t.co/Y9AUKDxHDy

Let’s be clear: Our government criminalizes too many things and sends too many people to jail. In a Warren administration, we will: 

☑️ Repeal the 1994 Crime Bill 
☑️ Legalize marijuana
☑️ Undo the legacy of the War on Drugs
☑️ End cash bail and private prisons

@maddygunawan It was great meeting you, Maddy. Thanks for being in this fight!
Mike Bloomberg is placing $34 million in TV ads in one week—the most of any presidential candidate in history.

White supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair. Now more than ever, all of us must embrace the lessons of Black history to confront this challenge. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/iPVwOk33HI
Racism props up the rich and powerful, leaving them free to take more power for themselves. And the rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. If we want power, we have to fight for it. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/owktsOca4G
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Yes, there’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.
@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.
@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.
@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!
@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.
@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.
@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.
@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.
@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.
@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.
@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.
@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?
@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.
@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf
@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.
@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.
@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.
@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.
@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!
@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”
@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.
@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.
@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.
@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.
@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.
@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU
@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.
I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we've fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarren
We're live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Tc7WIWuUuk
Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan.

@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!
Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3S
The way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll.
Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34K
Awood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAru
I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that.
This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.
Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylC

To everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7A
I believe that abortion rights are human rights.

I believe that they're also economic rights.

I’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebate
I just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlT
We have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebate
In my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3e
I’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It's time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9y
Abortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebate
When I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebate
Right now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebate
We need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here's what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:
✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k
✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools
✅ $50 billion in HBCUs
✅ Cancel student loan debt
#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqR
Our defense budget is massively bloated—we need to end the cozy relationship between defense contractors and the Pentagon, then pull out a sharp knife and make real cuts. I've got a plan for that. #DemDebate https://t.co/n4M5U2JJjN
All three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has toward military personnel and their families. And I’ve got a plan to honor our promises to our nation’s veterans, service members, military families, and survivors. #DemDebate https://t.co/pyMfCKdTgm
For decades, racist redlining practices blocked Black and Brown families from home ownership and building wealth. My housing plan helps level the playing field for families who were denied wealth-building opportunities. #DemDebate https://t.co/vb84trHx3O
Child care is personal for me. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child. It’ll be free for millions of families, and affordable for all. Use my calculator to see how much your family would save: https://t.co/urL0bLuxrg
Billionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04h
Tens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.
I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.

My #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebate
Let me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:

✔️ Universal Child Care
✔️ Universal pre-k
✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools
✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs
✔️ Cancel student loan debt 

#DemDebate
My #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebate
The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebate
The Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That's what's happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebate
Today’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebate
Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. I stand with @StaceyAbrams—and that's why I have a plan to guarantee the right to vote and end voter suppression. https://t.co/wRvU1FR0yJ
I had a wonderful time meeting Lily and her friend Jenny. Lily donated just $10 and won the @TeamWarren contest to join me at tonight's #DemDebate in Atlanta! Thank you both for being a part of this grassroots movement. https://t.co/lKEgC2KoOv
Big, structural change can't wait. @AyannaPressley and I are fighting for it together. https://t.co/mzr27o2FHE
I called @AdyBarkan to tell him that I'm so grateful to have him on @TeamWarren. I'm going to fight for Ady, Rachael, Carl, and Willow just as hard as I fight for my own family. We're going to make big, structural change, together. https://t.co/vcb8uQInF3
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetimes. In a Warren administration, we’ll root out Washington corruption once and for all.

Desde aumentar el salario mínimo federal hasta combatir la discriminación sistémica y proteger el derecho de las trabajadoras latinas a sindicalizarse: estoy lista para luchar desde el primer día para cerrar la brecha salarial. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/xkPRR5A2Dj https://t.co/kKTW1x7TyJ
It's long past time to close the Latina pay gap, and I've got a plan for that. From raising the federal minimum wage, to fighting systemic discrimination, to protecting Latina workers’ rights to unionize—I'm ready to fight on day one. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/54WDOq56co https://t.co/fgYdvNpscq
37 million Americans didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. 
36 million skipped a recommended test or treatment because of costs. 
40 million didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs.
This should never happen. It's time for #MedicareForAll.
On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we #SayTheirNames, and we re-commit to ending this epidemic. #TDoR https://t.co/6mTLM2grTq
I’m fighting my heart out for Rachael, for Carl, for baby Willow—and for you, @AdyBarkan.

(P.S. Willow: Your dad is an inspiration. I’m so honored to know him, and to fight alongside him for a better future for all.) https://t.co/PUqORwiJda
We wouldn't be this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without activists like @AdyBarkan, who has given his life to ensure that every American gets the medical care they need. I’m grateful down to my toes to be in this fight alongside you, Ady. https://t.co/jAo8dTcaAM
I’m deeply grateful to have your support in this fight, @AdyBarkan. I make this promise to you, to Willow, and to every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. 

We’re going to do this—side by side. Together. https://t.co/rS6PQvdNNB
White nationalist violence is a domestic terrorism threat—and we must treat it like one. I've got a plan to fight white nationalist violence. And when I'm president, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. https://t.co/AkO27jkySX
I'm standing with the Indiana teachers rallying for their schools. We need to invest in public education and our public school teachers. They're fighting for our students, so we should be fighting for them, too. #RedForEd https://t.co/QEzq5MwOlZ
We are facing a Black maternal mortality crisis in America. This is life and death for too many moms and babies. I've got a plan to end this epidemic. Thank you @NVPartnersLV and @StevenHorsford for welcoming me to the Black Community Summit. https://t.co/f6UpP3a1Iu
White nationalism has no place in our country, our White House, or our Congress. Let's start by getting Steve King out of office and electing @JDScholten to replace him. #IA04
I'm proud to fight alongside @AyannaPressley for the big, structural change we need—and so happy to announce that she'll be one of my special guests for my speech in Atlanta on Thursday! https://t.co/xbMgOhMCoS
From the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/AsdbVDKbsc
Our alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyv
I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2W
We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7f
Ultimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.
Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgv
I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bH
My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.
First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw
#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmf
Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6
Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.
Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.
I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.
Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.
Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.
Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.
We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.
But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.
Mother Emanuel AME Church.
Charlottesville.
Tree of Life Synagogue.
El Paso.
Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.
The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePg
Millions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I’ve got a plan to make housing more affordable, protect renters from unjust eviction and discrimination, and invest in healthy and green homes.

Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv
Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization. https://t.co/CLBQLPfTsu

Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm
Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.
Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. A true team with a spirit that’d do us all well.
Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm
.@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J
Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC.

As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why.

One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C

Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs

Happy Mother's Day to the most caring, brilliant, funny, and grounded woman I know—a perfect role model not just for our daughters, but so many others. Love you, @MichelleObama. https://t.co/liWmYaEPVk

Condolences to the family of John Singleton. His seminal work, Boyz n the Hood, remains one of the most searing, loving portrayals of the challenges facing inner-city youth. He opened doors for filmmakers of color to tell powerful stories that have been too often ignored.
Congratulations to the new class of @ObamaFoundation Fellows! Their work in every region of the globe is already making the world better, and I hope this experience helps them make an even bigger impact. https://t.co/azK2Y9Iw5c https://t.co/tuKO1SFhSK

Dominique’s story is a reminder to us that where you’re from shouldn’t define what you can achieve. I’m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. https://t.co/eD95oWrOk4
This generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world. So while this challenge is only getting more urgent, they show us the kind of action it'll take to meet this moment.
And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEI
I met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month. Luisa, the organizer behind the student movement in Germany, says, “It’s our future and we’re not going to stop fighting for it.” https://t.co/hS03PCWYAq
They're people like 16-year-old @GretaThunberg, whose protests at Swedish parliament sparked a movement. Inspired by Greta's action, Fridays for Future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate. https://t.co/un7nBhEF8i
Young people all over the world are leading the way in the fight to protect our planet because they know their future depends on it. This Earth Day, I want to celebrate the courageous, committed young leaders who are stepping up to save the one planet we've got.

The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka.
Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. https://t.co/SpMEvv1BzB
Congratulations, Tiger! To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit, and determination.

Great to see Chicago’s historic mayoral race between two highly qualified candidates. Congrats to our next mayor, Lori Lightfoot—and Toni Preckwinkle campaigned hard and did us proud. I know that with our city’s heart and Lori’s leadership, Chicago’s best days are still ahead.
Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know “Finding My Voice” will inspire others to lift their voices, too. https://t.co/nWTBDByMoz

In 2011, I visited the tiny town of Moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather Falmouth Kearney lived his early life. I'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the Irish people. Happy St. Patrick's Day! -Barack O’Bama https://t.co/abDtarFbR5
Michelle and I send our condolences to the people of New Zealand. We grieve with you and the Muslim community. All of us must stand against hatred in all its forms.

Preethi, Alice, and Sefora are just three of many @ObamaFoundation leaders who remind us what International Women’s Day is all about: imagining a world free of artificial ceilings for the next generation—and doing the hard work to get us there.
And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/cRb4EKcrvv
.@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she’s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. https://t.co/jNIiKIAZaO
.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the https://t.co/3RwHe5Razz Foundation, she’s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India—and beyond. https://t.co/TKuAKVL5Y1
On International Women’s Day, I’m reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. And I’m celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today.
It’s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair—everywhere—because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. Join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering: https://t.co/d7TYE8u0CD. https://t.co/rKchS3ltLI

I’ve always loved basketball because it’s about building a team that’s equal to more than the sum of its parts. Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. https://t.co/lghcLaUN9a
Happy Valentine’s Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It’s true; she does get down to Motown. https://t.co/uypbZsEiqB
In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them.
Don’t be sad it’s over, be proud it taught us so much. Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.
Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.
My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: https://t.co/gjBYHHImzB
We lost two great Americans today – Frank Robinson and John Dingell – citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field.
As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson’s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. https://t.co/Fl9aDxqcGi
The @ObamaFoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what’s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. https://t.co/hFAMzW7tBq
I’ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life’s most persistent and urgent question: "What are you doing for others?" Let’s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.
I knew it way back then and I’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uC9J4
In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’ll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody!
I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9
Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ
Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd
Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO
As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I’m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year.
As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL
Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/LKLqlYfFUw

As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/RMJgrWQhP2
No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I’m going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. https://t.co/8mHMsXGY0g
Happy Hanukkah! Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours.

Of course, @MichelleObama’s my wife, so I’m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise – one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE
Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who’s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who’ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk
To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend.
Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn
Today is the day. Today, it’s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. https://t.co/6xdMbKhwkr
If you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. Go vote! https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX
When you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance.
When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment – and make sure they’re paid equally.
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen.
Tomorrow’s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot.
Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP

Those protections and your health care are absolutely at stake on Tuesday. Vote for Democrats who’ll protect them. https://t.co/BDDmY60u8k
Not sure who and what you can vote for? Head over to https://t.co/SHxg6ael0O to look up your state, learn who's running to represent you, which measures you can help decide, and more. Read up, and get ready to vote on November 6.
Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power — use it!

We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.

From civil servants to organizers, the young people I met in Amsterdam today are doing the hard work of change. And they keep at it for their communities, their countries, and the collective future of Europe and the world. Keep up the good work. https://t.co/AVtuBPHdr2
The antidote to government by a powerful few is government by the organized, energized many. This National Voter Registration Day, make sure you're registered, vote early if you can, or show up on November 6. This moment is too important to sit out.
The first class of Obama Fellows is full of leaders like Keith—hardworking, innovative, and dedicated to partnering with their communities to drive transformational change. https://t.co/FN794E7Cqs

Bobby Kennedy was one of my heroes. He was someone who showed us the power of acting on our ideals, the idea that any of us can be one of the “million different centers of energy and daring” that ultimately combine to change the world for the better. https://t.co/nAiPiGercs
I’m confident that, together, they’ll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes.
Today I’m proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates – leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent: https://t.co/gWzalQhFas

The whistleblower sounded the alarm for an investigation, but all of the evidence has come from witnesses who saw Trump’s pressure campaign first-hand, including the President’s own words. We will not allow Trump to intimidate the whistleblower or any witness. #FaceTheNation https://t.co/nEltHste27

Millions of Americans, including @RepEscobar, have seen all that young Dreamers have to offer our country.

Yet it's been more than 160 days since the American Dream &amp; Promise Act passed the House.

@SenateMajLdr McConnell must allow a vote to #ProtectTheDream immediately. https://t.co/cOg2auYpIQ
Today, I was honored to sign @RepTedDeutch’s #PACTAct to make animal cruelty a federal offense. Our furry friends, Milo and Prudence, were on hand to help me enroll this bipartisan legislation that will now go to the President’s desk! https://t.co/3z35aMLRip
Today, we hear from one of our most respected diplomats, who spent her career as an anti-corruption crusader. She was viciously smeared by Trump’s allies, removed from her post, then threatened by the President on his “perfect” call. https://t.co/yJFVSQoNui
For Americans with diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life &amp; death.

When Members of Congress take the oath of office, we become custodians of the Constitution. We must uphold our duty to #DefendOurDemocracy.
We legislate. We investigate. We litigate. And yesterday, we had an important victory in our lawsuit to confirm Congress’s right to perform oversight, as the Court of Appeals ruled that the President’s financial records should be turned over to the Congress.
President Trump’s efforts to cover up his betrayal of his oath of office almost make the things Nixon did look small.
We are closely following updates regarding the school shooting in Santa Clarita. Thankful for courageous first responders working to save lives &amp; protect the community. What will it take for Republicans to stop blocking efforts to #EndGunViolence?

.@RepValDemings gets to the heart of the issue: the President placed his own political interests above our national interests, our national security, and our Constitution. The witnesses today saw the pressure campaign up close, and they had no doubt. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/Rp8uq6knCT

Public servants across the political spectrum understand that it's not about politics to #DefendOurDemocracy. President Trump's pressure campaign was "out of bounds," and every time he insists that it was "perfect" he is saying that he is above the law. https://t.co/5MQMrfZ5fl

Our inquiry has uncovered some profound betrayals of our Constitution, but it has also uncovered acts of profound patriotism by public servants who stood up for what was right. We will continue to conduct our inquiry aspiring to the same ideals. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/MasXETk7yf
The President pressured a foreign country to smear his political opponents. Please read his words:

“The US has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say it’s reciprocal.”

“I would like you to do us a favor though.”

If I was concerned about things being easy, I never would have come to Congress in the first place.

#DefendOurDemocracy #LSSC https://t.co/cSMn7Y8OLT
Our investigation into the President’s betrayal of his oath of office is based on a simple question: is it acceptable for a president to pressure a foreign government to undermine our elections for his political gain? #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/2c9RAT0t8f
The American people don’t need a grim reaper.
 
They need leaders who will #EndGunViolence, #SaveTheNet, and reinstate the protections found in #VAWA.
 
It’s time for Senate Republicans to get to work.

I’m sure a little encouragement from the President wouldn’t hurt.
The House has already passed these and many more, with passage of H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, coming soon as well. And yet Mitch McConnell wants to brag to his donors that he is the “Grim Reaper” instead of passing them.
H.R. 582 would #RaiseTheWage for workers across the country – reinvigorating the middle class &amp; strengthening our economy.
 
By passing the #ClimateActionNow Act, we will confront the Climate Crisis, something young people around the world are rightly demanding.
Some key examples?
 
H.R. 7, the #PaycheckFairness Act, would ensure equal pay for women nationwide.
 
Meanwhile, the #ForThePeople Act would enact the most ambitious set of democracy reforms and ethics standards in a generation.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The scores of bills we’ve passed aren’t busy work.
 
If passed into law, they will improve the lives of Americans across the country &amp; build a better future for generations to come.
 
But the @SenateGOP has made the cynical decision to ignore it all.
.@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Washington want you to think Democrats can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.
 
But we’ve been fighting #ForThePeople since Day One.
 
The House-passed legislation piling up outside @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office proves it. https://t.co/vgb0QajcaW

The enduring bravery of firefighters, first responders, state leaders &amp; National Guard responding to fires across California reminds us of the urgent threat of the climate crisis.

Dems will keep fighting the GOP's anti-science agenda &amp; urging Senate to pass #ClimateActionNow.
We’ve learned so much about Trump’s months-long campaign to pressure Ukraine because military veterans &amp; his own national security aides stood up to tell the truth. They put their country ahead of everything else. It’s not too late for Republicans in Congress to do the same.
Too often, the tragic reality of the Armenian Genocide has been denied. Today, an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the House ensured that the truth will forever be etched into the Congressional Record. https://t.co/9NE5XZyK3o
The House will vote on Thursday to move forward on open hearings as we set out the process for the next phase of our inquiry.

This sham ceasefire does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS from prisoners from escaping, and shows the President’s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS.
.@realDonaldTrump is flailing. Reversing sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America’s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike.
For 47 years, the #CleanWaterAct has safeguarded our children’s clean water. But since Day One, the Trump Admin has given big special interests free rein to poison our communities &amp; threaten families' health. @HouseDemocrats are ending this corruption &amp; fighting #ForThePeople.

Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President’s dangerous decision in Syria immediately.

Obamacare provided protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It was a huge step forward, but we can’t stop there. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.
We cannot let President Trump define who we are as a nation. America is hopeful and inclusive — we give hate no safe harbor and leave no one behind. We are everything that Donald Trump is not. https://t.co/98nSHN3hSJ
We’ve got to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class. That starts by strengthening public and private sector unions — because all workers should be empowered to bargain for what they deserve.

The American people are still waiting to see your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump. What are you hiding?
We must get Donald Trump out of the White House. Once we do, we can:

- Combat climate change
- Rebuild a more inclusive middle class
- Protect and build on Obamacare
- Ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful
I promise you that @DrBiden and I will be the best partners and fiercest advocates in the White House for America’s educators and students. https://t.co/wvI2e6TWb8

Our students and educators cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.

Weapons of war have no place in our communities.
 
I’ve successfully taken on the @NRA to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines before, and I’ll do it again in the White House. https://t.co/AbTUKdY7Bv
I’m running for president to build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.
Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We cannot stand by and watch that happen.
Health care is one of the biggest issues in this election. As president, I will ensure health care is a right, not a privilege — and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve. Read my full plan: https://t.co/ysfLJKi5xY
Climate change is an existential threat to our planet — we must take action.

Corruption is Donald Trump’s middle name.
We need to build an economy that reflects our values.

My administration will reverse the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations. We'll then use that money to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class.
Obamacare was and is a big deal. It saved lives and gave millions peace of mind. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over — we should protect and build on it. https://t.co/34NCSYzoUa
It’s clear that Donald Trump has abused the power of the presidency. Full stop.

Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate
Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant.
More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate
It’s not who we are. We are better than this. #DemDebate https://t.co/Gyo93iKomX
Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate
We are fired up and ready for Joe to take the stage at tonight’s #DemDebate! https://t.co/V0iGMuq3yu

@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be.
I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level. https://t.co/1CAhAjKEju
I am deeply disturbed by the news coming out of my law school alma mater, Syracuse University. We are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/m6BNczblXY
On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear.
Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.

China’s internment of nearly one million Uighur Muslims is among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today. The U.S. cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world. https://t.co/PQp04TWjyd

At the CNN Town Hall, I was asked what changes in American society I’m proudest of. Here’s what I had to say: https://t.co/X5OF6rwlJy
I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.

This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism. https://t.co/qmyRbxGdiq

Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.

Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer.
President Trump campaigned on repairing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But after countless “Infrastructure Weeks,” he has failed to deliver results. It has to change.

The Affordable Care Act
An assault weapons ban

First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy.

My plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.

Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same. Read my full plan: https://t.co/ysfLJK0u9o
A fresh Fall day in New Hampshire spent serving chili to our nation’s finest — firefighters. https://t.co/9BRPyeDkLk
Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.
Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7
This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.
25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education.
President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day. https://t.co/l1BIi9ffHm

Every kid deserves a quality education and every family deserves to live in a safe, healthy community. That's why I support the California #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst initiative that will make corporations pay their fair share and invest in our communities to help them thrive.
I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we unite this country, America’s best days still lie ahead.

If you agree, chip in today: https://t.co/ybhgvXSyRD
I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.
As California continues to burn, President Trump wants to withhold critical aid and abandon our firefighters when they need our support the most. It's reckless and cruel.

We must act now on climate change and support our firefighters and those affected by this disaster. https://t.co/EahL0fozXo
The courage and determination of folks like @fred_guttenberg have turned the fight for gun safety reform from a cause to a movement.

Together, we will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/IeJ4yOQ16q
Donald Trump wants to talk about corruption? That’s rich coming from the most corrupt president in modern history.

Getting the Violence Against Women Act passed is one of the highlights of my whole career. Now Senate Republicans are refusing to reauthorize it. To all the advocates and survivors speaking out - your voice makes all the difference. It always has. So keep it up. #VAWA4ALL
We’ve come too far with the Affordable Care Act to tear it down and start over. Building on Obamacare with a new public option is the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage. https://t.co/QbdijSL0se
Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security.
Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House.

Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform.
Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on &amp; off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL &amp; @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program.
Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness.

☑️ End cash bail and private prisons

@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Yes, there’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.
@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.
@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.
@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!
@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.
@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.
@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.
@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.
@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.
@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.
@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.
@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?
@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.
@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf
@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.
@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.
@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.
@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.
@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!
@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”
@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.
@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.
@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.
@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.
@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.
@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU
@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.

Reproductive rights are economic rights. Reproductive rights are human rights. And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.
@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!
Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3S
The way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll.
Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34K
Awood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAru
I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that.
This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.
Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylC
We're not leaving yet, Atlanta! Join us at @CAU on Thursday, where I'll be sharing the stories of some of the most persistent and fearless fighters, Black women who proved that when working women fight together, they win. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/XDcLiZccSL
To everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

I’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together. https://t.co/6Wir1mdB46
The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7A
I believe that abortion rights are human rights.

I believe that they're also economic rights.

And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. #DemDebate https://t.co/kDrlXSKr4Z
I’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebate
I just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlT
We have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebate
In my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3e
I’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It's time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9y
Abortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebate
When I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebate
Right now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebate
We need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here's what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:
✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k
✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools
✅ $50 billion in HBCUs
✅ Cancel student loan debt
#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqR
Our defense budget is massively bloated—we need to end the cozy relationship between defense contractors and the Pentagon, then pull out a sharp knife and make real cuts. I've got a plan for that. #DemDebate https://t.co/n4M5U2JJjN
All three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has toward military personnel and their families. And I’ve got a plan to honor our promises to our nation’s veterans, service members, military families, and survivors. #DemDebate https://t.co/pyMfCKdTgm
For decades, racist redlining practices blocked Black and Brown families from home ownership and building wealth. My housing plan helps level the playing field for families who were denied wealth-building opportunities. #DemDebate https://t.co/vb84trHx3O
Child care is personal for me. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child. It’ll be free for millions of families, and affordable for all. Use my calculator to see how much your family would save: https://t.co/urL0bLuxrg
Billionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04h
Tens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.
I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.

My #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebate
Let me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:

✔️ Universal Child Care
✔️ Universal pre-k
✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools
✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs
✔️ Cancel student loan debt 

#DemDebate
My #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebate
The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebate
The Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That's what's happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebate
Today’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebate
Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. I stand with @StaceyAbrams—and that's why I have a plan to guarantee the right to vote and end voter suppression. https://t.co/wRvU1FR0yJ
I had a wonderful time meeting Lily and her friend Jenny. Lily donated just $10 and won the @TeamWarren contest to join me at tonight's #DemDebate in Atlanta! Thank you both for being a part of this grassroots movement. https://t.co/lKEgC2KoOv
Big, structural change can't wait. @AyannaPressley and I are fighting for it together. https://t.co/mzr27o2FHE
I called @AdyBarkan to tell him that I'm so grateful to have him on @TeamWarren. I'm going to fight for Ady, Rachael, Carl, and Willow just as hard as I fight for my own family. We're going to make big, structural change, together. https://t.co/vcb8uQInF3
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetimes. In a Warren administration, we’ll root out Washington corruption once and for all.

Will you chip in $3 before the #DemDebate tonight to help our campaign keep fighting? https://t.co/EY02tTB1xF
Desde aumentar el salario mínimo federal hasta combatir la discriminación sistémica y proteger el derecho de las trabajadoras latinas a sindicalizarse: estoy lista para luchar desde el primer día para cerrar la brecha salarial. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/xkPRR5A2Dj https://t.co/kKTW1x7TyJ
It's long past time to close the Latina pay gap, and I've got a plan for that. From raising the federal minimum wage, to fighting systemic discrimination, to protecting Latina workers’ rights to unionize—I'm ready to fight on day one. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/54WDOq56co https://t.co/fgYdvNpscq
37 million Americans didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. 
36 million skipped a recommended test or treatment because of costs. 
40 million didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs.
This should never happen. It's time for #MedicareForAll.
On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we #SayTheirNames, and we re-commit to ending this epidemic. #TDoR https://t.co/6mTLM2grTq
I’m fighting my heart out for Rachael, for Carl, for baby Willow—and for you, @AdyBarkan.

(P.S. Willow: Your dad is an inspiration. I’m so honored to know him, and to fight alongside him for a better future for all.) https://t.co/PUqORwiJda
We wouldn't be this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without activists like @AdyBarkan, who has given his life to ensure that every American gets the medical care they need. I’m grateful down to my toes to be in this fight alongside you, Ady. https://t.co/jAo8dTcaAM
I’m deeply grateful to have your support in this fight, @AdyBarkan. I make this promise to you, to Willow, and to every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. 

We’re going to do this—side by side. Together. https://t.co/rS6PQvdNNB
White nationalist violence is a domestic terrorism threat—and we must treat it like one. I've got a plan to fight white nationalist violence. And when I'm president, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. https://t.co/AkO27jkySX
I'm standing with the Indiana teachers rallying for their schools. We need to invest in public education and our public school teachers. They're fighting for our students, so we should be fighting for them, too. #RedForEd https://t.co/QEzq5MwOlZ
We are facing a Black maternal mortality crisis in America. This is life and death for too many moms and babies. I've got a plan to end this epidemic. Thank you @NVPartnersLV and @StevenHorsford for welcoming me to the Black Community Summit. https://t.co/f6UpP3a1Iu
White nationalism has no place in our country, our White House, or our Congress. Let's start by getting Steve King out of office and electing @JDScholten to replace him. #IA04
I'm proud to fight alongside @AyannaPressley for the big, structural change we need—and so happy to announce that she'll be one of my special guests for my speech in Atlanta on Thursday! https://t.co/xbMgOhMCoS
From the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/AsdbVDKbsc
Our alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyv
I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2W
We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7f
Ultimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.
Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgv
I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bH
My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.
First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw
#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmf
Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6
Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.
Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.
I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.
Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.
Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.
Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.
We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.
But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.
Mother Emanuel AME Church.
Charlottesville.
Tree of Life Synagogue.
El Paso.
Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.
The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePg
Millions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I’ve got a plan to make housing more affordable, protect renters from unjust eviction and discrimination, and invest in healthy and green homes.

The way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win! https://t.co/NyOX0QhIhs

Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: "Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity." https://t.co/AZC9kpqoqx
Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv
Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization. https://t.co/CLBQLPfTsu

Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt.

Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm
Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.
Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. A true team with a spirit that’d do us all well.
Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm
.@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J
Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC.

As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why.

One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C

The most important job in our democracy is citizen. If you’re tired of politicians manipulating maps and ignoring the will of voters, I hope you’ll sign @allontheline’s Citizen Commitment today: https://t.co/CUAaoAGY6z
50 years ago, history was written at the Stonewall Inn when New York's LGBT community stood up, spoke out, and started a movement. In 2016 I was proud to designate it as a national monument—a reminder the arc of our history is an arc of progress as long as we keep pushing for it. https://t.co/xyvYfuoJwK
What a gift to come across this interview with Julia “Hurricane” Hawkins. I’m as grateful for her life advice as I am impressed by her 100-meter dash time. https://t.co/8lc9Cimqyt
Now we’re talking! Congrats to Team USA for moving on, and thanks for continuing to make us all proud. #USA https://t.co/DVkKBfU6wA
On Juneteenth, we celebrate our capacity to make real the promise of our founding, that thing inside each of us that says America is not yet finished, that compels all of us to fight for justice and equality until this country we love more closely aligns with our highest ideals. https://t.co/2XAKRuRrbG
Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: https://t.co/kSkLHbfnc3
This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn’t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96B7fkBM4u
Yes we can, Greta. I’m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. https://t.co/sUBwC0uNW8
Happy Father’s Day to Charles, one of our @ObamaFoundation Fellows, and all the dads at Fathers’ Uplift. Today, we’re celebrating fathers like these who provide a powerful example—not only for their kids, but for the rest of us, too. https://t.co/GJsxi8DozY
The @USWNT is something to smile about. It was great to celebrate with them back in 2015 and I'm excited to root them on in their drive to earn their fourth star. Best of luck to these champions for equality, on and off the field. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/AHcHGATy5S
Six years ago, David Ortiz's spirit and resolve helped us all begin to heal from the Boston Marathon bombing. Today, I want to join many others in wishing him a speedy recovery of his own. Get well soon, Papi. https://t.co/9orpBgnVI5
Last week, it was Virginia Beach. But day after day and year after year, too many families and communities are shattered by senseless gun violence. We can't get numb to this. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, pledge to speak out, #WearOrange — and vote — to protect lives.
You've got a lot to be proud of, Jiwandeep. Thanks for everything you do to make this country a little more equal. Turban looks great, by the way. Happy Pride Month, everybody! https://t.co/SO7mgnOkgl
What a life. American history has always been driven by visionaries like Leah Chase—and all the men and women who worked and ate at Dooky Chase’s over the years—folks who serve up progress one bowl of gumbo at a time. https://t.co/2LpuIbxvHk https://t.co/Y4i5snKjn7
A story worth sharing: Twelve years ago, Brian joined my first presidential campaign. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with ALS and launched @iamalsorg to find a cure. Brian and Sandra wake up every day believing that we can win this fight—and that makes me hopeful, too. https://t.co/eETCgFnLgP
Exciting to see the faces of Colombia's future at an @ObamaFoundation roundtable with young leaders in Bogotá. Their creativity, their compassion, and their drive to improve their country are promising signs of what's to come. https://t.co/HrhreUuPMa
On Memorial Day, we remember all those who gave everything for something greater than themselves. It's up to us to not simply reflect on their sacrifice but to honor it with service of our own—and by living out the values they fought for. https://t.co/tZx3qcHnfV
Great to get out there and take a few cuts at the plate yesterday—I had a blast with all these extraordinary young people. Thanks for letting me drop in and thanks to the Nationals Youth Academy for the outstanding work you do to support youth in DC. https://t.co/GKRMd8kZxm
Here’s a great story: While we’ve still got a lot of work to do to make college affordable for everyone, that didn’t stop Robert F. Smith from seizing an opportunity to make a difference. He’s erasing the student loan debt for this year’s @Morehouse grads. https://t.co/I3X38Pbpjz
Happy Mother's Day to the most caring, brilliant, funny, and grounded woman I know—a perfect role model not just for our daughters, but so many others. Love you, @MichelleObama. https://t.co/liWmYaEPVk
As part of the @ObamaFoundation, moms like Dr. Mwansa Ketty Lubeya are answering the call for change—and raising the next generation of leaders while they’re at it. https://t.co/llToyKG2Y7
Happy #CollegeSigningDay, everybody! I'm proud of every student out there who's taking the next step in their education. It's the best thing you can do for yourself and your future. https://t.co/SZQaUG2Zze
Condolences to the family of John Singleton. His seminal work, Boyz n the Hood, remains one of the most searing, loving portrayals of the challenges facing inner-city youth. He opened doors for filmmakers of color to tell powerful stories that have been too often ignored.
Congratulations to the new class of @ObamaFoundation Fellows! Their work in every region of the globe is already making the world better, and I hope this experience helps them make an even bigger impact. https://t.co/azK2Y9Iw5c https://t.co/tuKO1SFhSK
For thirty-six years, Richard Lugar proved that pragmatism and decency work—not only in Washington but all over the world. Michelle and I send our warmest sympathies to his family and all those who had the privilege of knowing this American statesman. https://t.co/Oy5DzPwkGb
Dominique’s story is a reminder to us that where you’re from shouldn’t define what you can achieve. I’m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. https://t.co/eD95oWrOk4
This generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world. So while this challenge is only getting more urgent, they show us the kind of action it'll take to meet this moment.
And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEI
I met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month. Luisa, the organizer behind the student movement in Germany, says, “It’s our future and we’re not going to stop fighting for it.” https://t.co/hS03PCWYAq
They're people like 16-year-old @GretaThunberg, whose protests at Swedish parliament sparked a movement. Inspired by Greta's action, Fridays for Future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate. https://t.co/un7nBhEF8i
Young people all over the world are leading the way in the fight to protect our planet because they know their future depends on it. This Earth Day, I want to celebrate the courageous, committed young leaders who are stepping up to save the one planet we've got.
To all who celebrate today, happy Easter from our family to yours! On this day of rebirth and renewal, let’s recommit to love and serve our brothers and sisters, especially those in need, in every way we can. Have a great day, everybody. https://t.co/BtMyWebGLw
The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka.
Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. https://t.co/SpMEvv1BzB
Congratulations, Tiger! To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit, and determination.
Another good story worth sharing: From one "kid from Akron" to a new generation of Akron kids, some remarkable early achievements at @IPROMISESchool. Great work, @KingJames—and even better work by those students. Proud to be a witness to their success: https://t.co/ctWfKnA5GL
From a big NBA fan, congrats to future Hall of Famers Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki—not just all-time greats but class acts, too.
In just a few minutes, I’m taking the stage at the @ObamaFoundation Town Hall Europe for a conversation about how to best support civic leaders carrying out good work across the continent. I hope you’ll tune in live at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/Ds4I8wFFM1
A voice everybody should hear. https://t.co/0u7HUlQ8id
Here’s a story about people doing good that's worth sharing: @BradPaisley and his wife @Kimwilliamspais saw food insecurity in Nashville and decided to do something about it. They just broke ground on a free grocery store to help families in need: https://t.co/o6pcAApZsm
Great to see Chicago’s historic mayoral race between two highly qualified candidates. Congrats to our next mayor, Lori Lightfoot—and Toni Preckwinkle campaigned hard and did us proud. I know that with our city’s heart and Lori’s leadership, Chicago’s best days are still ahead.
Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know “Finding My Voice” will inspire others to lift their voices, too. https://t.co/nWTBDByMoz
Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress—it's a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who’ve taken the torch. This group is going to be driving progress for a long time to come. https://t.co/W5dDlDtNzE
Just in the nick of time: My brackets have never been my one shining moment, but here we go again. You can check out my #MarchMadness picks here: https://t.co/c3bjNrIo4w https://t.co/EcCUdnZjun

The floods in the Midwest and in southern Africa are heartbreaking. Suffering and loss on two sides of the world calls for solidarity and strength from all of us. Ask what you can do to help our fellow Americans and families in need. Here are some ideas: https://t.co/jWJlKABqAb
In 2011, I visited the tiny town of Moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather Falmouth Kearney lived his early life. I'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the Irish people. Happy St. Patrick's Day! -Barack O’Bama https://t.co/abDtarFbR5
Michelle and I send our condolences to the people of New Zealand. We grieve with you and the Muslim community. All of us must stand against hatred in all its forms.
.@MichelleObama and I are rooting hard for Team USA as the Special Olympics World Games get underway this week. Our Special Olympians are terrific examples of America’s heart and drive.
What a great moment. Happy 110th, Virginia. https://t.co/FuNZV3RRV4
Michelle and I send our deepest sympathies to all who knew the victims of today’s plane crash in Ethiopia.
The Crew Dragon’s been on quite a ride since I last saw it—congrats to @NASA and @SpaceX on a successful return! We invested in the @Commercial_Crew program to strengthen the U.S. space program for the long haul, and it’s great to see that happening. https://t.co/Dsu5mZcaCZ
Preethi, Alice, and Sefora are just three of many @ObamaFoundation leaders who remind us what International Women’s Day is all about: imagining a world free of artificial ceilings for the next generation—and doing the hard work to get us there.
And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/cRb4EKcrvv
.@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she’s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. https://t.co/jNIiKIAZaO
.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the https://t.co/3RwHe5Razz Foundation, she’s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India—and beyond. https://t.co/TKuAKVL5Y1
On International Women’s Day, I’m reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. And I’m celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today.
It’s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair—everywhere—because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. Join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering: https://t.co/d7TYE8u0CD. https://t.co/rKchS3ltLI
Zion Williamson seems like an outstanding young man as well as an outstanding basketball player. Wishing him a speedy recovery.
I’m about to join @StephenCurry30 on stage with @MBK_Alliance to answer questions from boys and young men of color about the challenges that confront them and the opportunities within their grasp. Tune in at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4.
I’ve always loved basketball because it’s about building a team that’s equal to more than the sum of its parts. Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. https://t.co/lghcLaUN9a
Happy Valentine’s Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It’s true; she does get down to Motown. https://t.co/uypbZsEiqB
In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them.
Don’t be sad it’s over, be proud it taught us so much. Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.
Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.
My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: https://t.co/gjBYHHImzB
We lost two great Americans today – Frank Robinson and John Dingell – citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field.
As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson’s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. https://t.co/Fl9aDxqcGi
The @ObamaFoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what’s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. https://t.co/hFAMzW7tBq
I’ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life’s most persistent and urgent question: "What are you doing for others?" Let’s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.
I knew it way back then and I’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uC9J4
In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’ll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody!
I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9
Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ
Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd
Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO
As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I’m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year.
As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL
Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/LKLqlYfFUw
There’s no better time than the holidays to give back to your community. Yesterday I got to do just that at @ChildrensHealth. As we celebrate the season and look forward to 2019, let’s recommit to doing our part to build a world that is a little more generous, tolerant, and kind. https://t.co/77rcNoY8jn
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to the extraordinary kids, families, and staff at Children’s National. And thanks for humoring me as your stand-in Santa. https://t.co/mFmYCVk7cr
Today is the last day of open enrollment. That means it’s the deadline to make sure you and the people you love have health insurance in 2019. So head over to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod to get covered! Here’s what else you need to know today about health care: https://t.co/gosn6c6uCa
Joe is right. Head to https://t.co/SS87NTsgJt before tomorrow’s deadline. And nice bracelet, by the way. https://t.co/NFy3LxZe3f
As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/RMJgrWQhP2
No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I’m going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. https://t.co/8mHMsXGY0g
Happy Hanukkah! Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours.
America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight – and all who were inspired by George and Barbara’s example. https://t.co/g9OUPu2pjY
I am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be. Who understand that hope requires action. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/AbjXUwCh6z
Thanks to the Chicago @FoodDepository team for all you do and to the volunteers who are doing great work and let me crash today. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! https://t.co/r4QeBeCoT1

Our future depends on all our young people, including our boys and young men of color, being able to achieve their dreams. Today, I’m proud to share @MBK_Alliance’s first investments in communities devoted to this mission. Get inspired: https://t.co/dKLWPvrFPC
Of course, @MichelleObama’s my wife, so I’m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise – one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE
Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who’s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who’ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk
To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend.
Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn
Today is the day. Today, it’s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. https://t.co/6xdMbKhwkr
If you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. Go vote! https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX
When you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance.
When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment – and make sure they’re paid equally.
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen.
Tomorrow’s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot.
Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP
Elections matter. You have the power to protect a family’s health care. Make a plan, grab some friends, and vote: https://t.co/rY8Ip1km9p
While we're talking about preexisting conditions, the ACA is the law that finally protected your coverage for preexisting conditions.

Those protections and your health care are absolutely at stake on Tuesday. Vote for Democrats who’ll protect them. https://t.co/BDDmY60u8k
Not sure who and what you can vote for? Head over to https://t.co/SHxg6ael0O to look up your state, learn who's running to represent you, which measures you can help decide, and more. Read up, and get ready to vote on November 6.
Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power — use it!

We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.
The last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. More people go to Coachella. There’s no good excuse not to vote.

From civil servants to organizers, the young people I met in Amsterdam today are doing the hard work of change. And they keep at it for their communities, their countries, and the collective future of Europe and the world. Keep up the good work. https://t.co/AVtuBPHdr2
The antidote to government by a powerful few is government by the organized, energized many. This National Voter Registration Day, make sure you're registered, vote early if you can, or show up on November 6. This moment is too important to sit out.
The first class of Obama Fellows is full of leaders like Keith—hardworking, innovative, and dedicated to partnering with their communities to drive transformational change. https://t.co/FN794E7Cqs
We will always remember everyone we lost on 9/11, thank the first responders who keep us safe, and honor all who defend our country and the ideals that bind us together. There's nothing our resilience and resolve can’t overcome, and no act of terror can ever change who we are.
Today I’m at the University of Illinois to deliver a simple message to young people all over the country: You need to vote, because our democracy depends on it. I hope you'll tune in at 11am CT: https://t.co/34WjNaVAcU

Our statement on the passing of Senator John McCain: https://t.co/3GBjNYxoj5
Aretha helped define the American experience. In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade—our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect. May the Queen of Soul rest in eternal peace. https://t.co/bfASqKlLc5
Bobby Kennedy was one of my heroes. He was someone who showed us the power of acting on our ideals, the idea that any of us can be one of the “million different centers of energy and daring” that ultimately combine to change the world for the better. https://t.co/nAiPiGercs
I’m confident that, together, they’ll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes.
Today I’m proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates – leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent: https://t.co/gWzalQhFas
Mandela Day is about taking action to change the world for the better. In these young people, I see Madiba's example of persistence and hope. They are poised to make this world more peaceful, more prosperous, and more just. https://t.co/GJDuOs1hkH
This week, I’m traveling to Africa for the first time since I left office – a continent of wonderful diversity, thriving culture, and remarkable stories. As I prepare for this trip, I wanted to share a list of books that I’d recommend for summer reading: https://t.co/W4Jc0N23iy
San Francisco Mayor George Moscone &amp; Supervisor Harvey Milk embodied the optimistic, progressive vision of our city. 41 years after they were murdered in a shocking act of brutality, we will never stop advancing their mission to bring about a more caring, inclusive future.
These are the facts, and they are not contested. Read the timeline of Trump’s pressure campaign to get a foreign country to interfere in our elections. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/RnUxIbCvrC
The Courts have been clear again in the McGahn case: the President’s insistence that he is above the law is an offense to our Constitution and to every American. #DefendOurDemocracy 
https://t.co/TsNUWghceE
No one is above the law, not even the President. #DefendOurDemocracy. https://t.co/fFfYVHKbiw
All freedom-loving people in the U.S. and around the world are inspired by yesterday’s historic vote in #HongKong! The people of Hong Kong cast their resounding vote for democratic freedoms and autonomy, which must be fully respected by Beijing.
Reports that more than 100 protestors have been killed by Iranian security forces raise serious concerns. All Iranians should be able to make their voices heard without fear of reprisal. Iran must immediately restore full internet access and allow all to speak out.
Whether calling on @SenateMajLdr McConnell to finally call a vote on life-saving legislation to #EndGunViolence or hearing from young immigration activists, we will never give up our fight #ForThePeople. Here are a few moments that stood out. https://t.co/uOrN7VthNR

The President’s call set off alarms across the White House.

“The US has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say it’s reciprocal.”

“I would like you to do us a favor though.”

“There’s been a lot of talk about Biden’s son.”

Watch the witnesses at 9:00:

Today, @HouseDemocrats marched to @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office to demand action to #EndGunViolence.

When Members of Congress take the oath of office, we become custodians of the Constitution. We must uphold our duty to #DefendOurDemocracy.
We legislate. We investigate. We litigate. And yesterday, we had an important victory in our lawsuit to confirm Congress’s right to perform oversight, as the Court of Appeals ruled that the President’s financial records should be turned over to the Congress.
President Trump’s efforts to cover up his betrayal of his oath of office almost make the things Nixon did look small.
We are closely following updates regarding the school shooting in Santa Clarita. Thankful for courageous first responders working to save lives &amp; protect the community. What will it take for Republicans to stop blocking efforts to #EndGunViolence?

The American people don’t need a grim reaper.
 
They need leaders who will #EndGunViolence, #SaveTheNet, and reinstate the protections found in #VAWA.
 
It’s time for Senate Republicans to get to work.

I’m sure a little encouragement from the President wouldn’t hurt.
The House has already passed these and many more, with passage of H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, coming soon as well. And yet Mitch McConnell wants to brag to his donors that he is the “Grim Reaper” instead of passing them.
H.R. 582 would #RaiseTheWage for workers across the country – reinvigorating the middle class &amp; strengthening our economy.
 
By passing the #ClimateActionNow Act, we will confront the Climate Crisis, something young people around the world are rightly demanding.
Some key examples?
 
H.R. 7, the #PaycheckFairness Act, would ensure equal pay for women nationwide.
 
Meanwhile, the #ForThePeople Act would enact the most ambitious set of democracy reforms and ethics standards in a generation.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The scores of bills we’ve passed aren’t busy work.
 
If passed into law, they will improve the lives of Americans across the country &amp; build a better future for generations to come.
 
But the @SenateGOP has made the cynical decision to ignore it all.
.@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Washington want you to think Democrats can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.
 
But we’ve been fighting #ForThePeople since Day One.
 
The House-passed legislation piling up outside @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office proves it. https://t.co/vgb0QajcaW

We’ve learned so much about Trump’s months-long campaign to pressure Ukraine because military veterans &amp; his own national security aides stood up to tell the truth. They put their country ahead of everything else. It’s not too late for Republicans in Congress to do the same.

This sham ceasefire does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS from prisoners from escaping, and shows the President’s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS.
.@realDonaldTrump is flailing. Reversing sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America’s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike.
For 47 years, the #CleanWaterAct has safeguarded our children’s clean water. But since Day One, the Trump Admin has given big special interests free rein to poison our communities &amp; threaten families' health. @HouseDemocrats are ending this corruption &amp; fighting #ForThePeople.

We can save billions by finally negotiating for #LowerDrugCosts. And that’s just the beginning: H.R. 3 would extend those lower prices to Americans across the country. https://t.co/evDporagP8
As we find ourselves in a situation where the President gave a green light to the Turks to bomb and effectively unleashed ISIS, we must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting.
Next, we must put together the strongest bipartisan, bicameral sanctions package similar to the bipartisan bill the House is advancing.
Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President’s dangerous decision in Syria immediately.

No one should struggle to pay bills because they got in an accident.

Scientists have told us we must take action immediately to avoid climate catastrophe.

A Green New Deal is not "radical," "unrealistic," or "too expensive."

It is what is absolutely necessary.

Many of those seeking asylum on our southern border are fleeing horrific forms of gender-based violence. As president, I will restore asylum status for domestic violence survivors &amp; spearhead an initiative to end violence against women and girls in Central America. #16Days
Obamacare provided protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It was a huge step forward, but we can’t stop there. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care.
We cannot let President Trump define who we are as a nation. America is hopeful and inclusive — we give hate no safe harbor and leave no one behind. We are everything that Donald Trump is not. https://t.co/98nSHN3hSJ

The American people are still waiting to see your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump. What are you hiding?
We must get Donald Trump out of the White House. Once we do, we can:

- Combat climate change
- Rebuild a more inclusive middle class
- Protect and build on Obamacare
- Ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful

Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We cannot stand by and watch that happen.

Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate
Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant.
More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate
It’s not who we are. We are better than this. #DemDebate https://t.co/Gyo93iKomX
Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate

@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be.
I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level. https://t.co/1CAhAjKEju
I am deeply disturbed by the news coming out of my law school alma mater, Syracuse University. We are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/m6BNczblXY
On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear.
Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.

I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.

This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism. https://t.co/qmyRbxGdiq

President Trump campaigned on repairing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But after countless “Infrastructure Weeks,” he has failed to deliver results. It has to change.

Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation. He should be impeached. https://t.co/4YWvi0HLxh
At tonight's @CNN Town Hall in Iowa, I laid out my bold vision for the country and why I'm the best candidate in this race to beat Donald Trump and unite our nation.

If you liked what you heard, join our team and let's get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju
Looking forward to joining @ErinBurnett for tonight’s town hall in Iowa to discuss what’s at stake in this election and why I’m running for president. Tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live.
Our veterans and their families represent the absolute best that our country has to offer. I had the honor of spending Veterans Day in Iowa with a few of them. https://t.co/ziNM4qRHL2
The campaign trail is always more fun when you join, @DrBiden. What a great weekend in New Hampshire! https://t.co/5zX5CZjM3N
President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families. 

As president, I will meet our sacred obligation. https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.

Thank you to all who have served — on Veterans Day and every day. https://t.co/SQBUj8nwmw
I understand the sleepless nights, wondering if your deployed child is safe, and all the added sacrifices military families face because their loved one chose selfless service.

As president, I'll take care of our troops and their families. https://t.co/iNuNHlPsg1
Less than 1% of our population risks everything to protect our country — the other 99% of us owe them more than we could ever repay. #VeteransDay https://t.co/ChF786cRlO
Today, I’m releasing my plan to ensure our veterans receive what they deserve: our respect and enduring gratitude, and the benefits they have earned.  

Read my full plan: https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by the men and women who defend our nation at war. Veterans Day offers us a moment to reflect on that obligation, and to recommit ourselves to all that it truly means. https://t.co/X0YAR8r3Xj
Together we can, and will, make Donald Trump a one-term president.
We don’t say it enough — Barack Obama was a great president. And I’m proud to have worked alongside him. https://t.co/5pIZxkNxyj
HBCUs and MSIs play a vital role in our communities. As president, I’ll invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.

Read my full plan: https://t.co/MxizpNiekL
I’m running for president to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.

If you’re with me, join us: https://t.co/qN0D1vhO9N
The ACA was, and is, a big deal. It took generations of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done. 

I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat.
There is no denying the devastating effects climate change has on our planet — we need to take action. 

As president, I’ll lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo.
https://t.co/hHMvdBHLY3
Thirty years ago today, the people of Berlin tore down a wall and vanquished a dictatorship. We must not forget the lessons of 1989. The United States must reclaim its mantle as the champion of democracy. The stakes are simply too high. https://t.co/3LkGwfzp6U
Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them. https://t.co/jtOPJDnE30
My plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.

Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same. Read my full plan: https://t.co/ysfLJK0u9o
A fresh Fall day in New Hampshire spent serving chili to our nation’s finest — firefighters. https://t.co/9BRPyeDkLk
Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.
Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7
This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.
25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education.
President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day. https://t.co/l1BIi9ffHm
It’s official — we’re on the ballot in New Hampshire. 

Join us: https://t.co/qN0D1vzpyn. https://t.co/UcwiuobICO
Every kid deserves a quality education and every family deserves to live in a safe, healthy community. That's why I support the California #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst initiative that will make corporations pay their fair share and invest in our communities to help them thrive.
I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we unite this country, America’s best days still lie ahead.

If you agree, chip in today: https://t.co/ybhgvXSyRD
I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.
As California continues to burn, President Trump wants to withhold critical aid and abandon our firefighters when they need our support the most. It's reckless and cruel.

We must act now on climate change and support our firefighters and those affected by this disaster. https://t.co/EahL0fozXo
The courage and determination of folks like @fred_guttenberg have turned the fight for gun safety reform from a cause to a movement.

Together, we will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/IeJ4yOQ16q
Donald Trump wants to talk about corruption? That’s rich coming from the most corrupt president in modern history.

Tell Trump to release his taxes or shut up about corruption: https://t.co/hc4cbU9CL8 https://t.co/ozhDumIxsv
Getting the Violence Against Women Act passed is one of the highlights of my whole career. Now Senate Republicans are refusing to reauthorize it. To all the advocates and survivors speaking out - your voice makes all the difference. It always has. So keep it up. #VAWA4ALL
We’ve come too far with the Affordable Care Act to tear it down and start over. Building on Obamacare with a new public option is the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage. https://t.co/QbdijSL0se
Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security.
Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House.
Last night's results showed that Democrats can take back our country, starting with Virginia, and begin the hard work of growing a stronger, more inclusive middle class and restoring the soul of our nation.

Chip in to help us take back the White House: https://t.co/Z9v6FGZH0r
I'm running for president to unite this country. There's nothing we cannot do if we do it together. https://t.co/RnwM8UEVUq
If you have DACA status, and it expires within the year, it’s critical that you renew as soon as possible to protect your status until we find a permanent solution.

DREAMers are Americans — and it’s time we make it official. #HomeIsHere https://t.co/EIxZz19kfv
Hottest summer on record: 2019
Hottest September on record: 2019
Hottest October on record: 2019

There is no time to waste. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and address the climate emergency. The survival of our planet depends on it. https://t.co/0ex6xguIIQ
To the millions of people who get up every single day and make this country work: I see you, and I will never stop fighting for you. You are the backbone of America. https://t.co/GdCmhoKtT8
Congratulations to Governor-Elect @AndyBeshearKY on his hard-earned victory. He has served the people of Kentucky well as attorney general — the Commonwealth is in good hands with him in the governor's office.
Tonight, by voting in Democratic majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, Virginians sent a clear, powerful message that will resonate across this nation and shake the walls of the White House. https://t.co/78UbWLWX4h
The growing mountain of evidence makes one thing clear: We must impeach Donald Trump. https://t.co/bPhLx6N79Z
I have fought for the Democratic Party my whole career. That’s not something everyone in this primary can say. https://t.co/JCNqAlbSo0
Obamacare protects over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions — including Joe and Michelle’s son Matt. We cannot afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it. https://t.co/yX6jDCg8fG
Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform.
Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on &amp; off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL &amp; @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program.
Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness.
The U.S. is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of the power of our example.

That’s what has always set us apart on the world stage, and that’s something Donald Trump will never understand. https://t.co/omaa5OTMc0
Faith, hope, and dignity sound good to me. https://t.co/iVd6fc3qTy
Today is Election Day in Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey, Virginia, and cities across the nation. Your vote matters — find your polling place, bring a friend, and head to the polls to make your voice heard: https://t.co/841UwMNWxp

250 days. @Senatemajldr McConnell, do your job and bring the universal background check bill up for a vote. https://t.co/rFzGmv4vDN
I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t President Trump?

He should release his taxes or shut up about corruption. https://t.co/7NrKkagZlt
As the climate crisis worsens each day and California burns and Iowa floods, Trump continues to abandon science and our international leadership. He just notified the United Nations of our official withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. It's shameful. https://t.co/5UikQrsS3u
President Trump has turned his back on those he promised to help. He thinks he’s being tough with his trade war, but he’s really being reckless. And American workers are paying the price. 

I will ensure our policies put American workers first. https://t.co/oui5atVxXl
A country that ignores the threat to the very survival of this planet isn’t just troubled — it’s morally bankrupt.

We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and take urgent action to address the climate emergency.
Is anyone surprised that all it takes is a $100 saw to breach Trump’s wall? This whole exercise was a stunt and a sham from the beginning. The only thing the wall has succeeded in doing is tarnishing the image of our nation in the eyes of the world. https://t.co/9d8lNoCEth
This is a dangerous decision by the Trump Administration. We should be strengthening our clean water protections and holding polluters accountable for their actions — not loosening restrictions on toxic waste. https://t.co/asV8E9gCLb
This Tuesday, we have the opportunity to set an example for the nation  and turn the Virginia state legislature blue. But only if everyone turns out to vote: https://t.co/ZsLycRC1bv https://t.co/TVtZJQR9hI
100 days until the New Hampshire primary.
One year until Election Day 2020.

There’s no time to waste, chip in $5 now to help us make Donald Trump a one-term president: https://t.co/4Y0hGTrRTg https://t.co/QSSsgFZ8iJ
Governor Northam, you have the opportunity to empower unions and working families. You should take it. https://t.co/laaNjR2yzb
I'm so grateful for Amber Torres's support and I will fight to ensure the United States meets its trust and treaty obligations. https://t.co/t50J8ixOIe
This is cruel and appalling. These students simply dreamed of getting the high-quality higher education America can offer. ICE deceived and entrapped them, just to deport them. https://t.co/t6kQLiV5oh
I'm proud to stand alongside @Deb4CongressNM in the fight to ensure that the United States honors its promises and commitments to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples. https://t.co/qjTZybxL37
At its best, America is a place for big dreams and second chances. That’s what I’ve always fought for, and that’s the America I want us to build together. https://t.co/j42UClCodh
The Trump administration's cruel and dangerous policies are putting children in danger and driving families apart. When I'm president, I'll end his racist policies and welcome immigrants and asylum seekers. https://t.co/Sm91Xp9nCl
Presidential candidates typically do "call time"—also known as calling wealthy donors and asking for big checks.

Not me. Our campaign is funded by grassroots donors like you. Will you pitch in now? https://t.co/1tDuvv0GYu
Google recently hired a notorious union-busting firm—and yesterday, fired four employees who were organizing their colleagues and holding Google accountable. I stand with Rebecca Rivers and her colleagues. I’ll always fight to protect workers’ rights. https://t.co/dUIsEd58jY
Monopolies are bad for consumers and our economy—and they're bad for employees, too.

But when workers build a grassroots movement and fight together to hold Big Tech companies like Amazon accountable, they can win. https://t.co/XQ1Iku6zpp
Dream big, fight hard, put on your sweatshirt, and let’s get to work! https://t.co/JP6wo9OkNp
Yup, I’m tired of “Woe Is Me” billionaires too, @TrevorNoah. My #WealthTax will help families afford child care, college, and free an entire generation from student loan debt—and the billionaires will be just fine. https://t.co/JrkfTPqkt8
Some billionaires figured it might be cheaper to run for president than pay my #WealthTax. Well they don’t have the power of a grassroots movement—and in our democracy, I believe in the power of people over money. https://t.co/tDo1Rjg4WM
Fighting for the #GreenNewDeal isn't just about fighting climate change. It's a commitment to building a better future for the working people of our country by creating millions of good union jobs. We can’t fight climate change with a low-wage economy.
We need to build a new farm economy that is truly open to all. I’ve listened to Black farmers and updated my plan to reflect their experiences. We must root out structural racism to ensure Black farmers succeed. https://t.co/Y9AUKDxHDy
We need bold action now to pass the #GreenNewDeal, build a green new economy, and defeat the climate crisis—and I've got a plan for that. I'm proud to work alongside groups like @SunriseMvmt to build the grassroots movement we need to fight climate change. https://t.co/GHJKDCloow
After my daddy's heart attack, he couldn't work for a while. So my mother got a minimum wage job—and that job saved our house. She was scared, but she found the strength to do what needed to be done to save our family. https://t.co/oeMFWT4Jq5
I’ve got a lot of plans to bring big, structural change to Washington. But first, there's one plan that makes it all possible: Making sure we hit our monthly fundraising goals.

Can I count on you to pitch in to our grassroots movement before midnight? https://t.co/W0M93uwDUU
Private companies shouldn't be able to profit off of incarcerated people by charging them to read a book or video call their family. My plan for criminal justice reform will rein in this exploitation. https://t.co/WY2oZ41229
I've proposed the biggest and most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly half a century—an immediate $200 monthly increase. Families need financial security.
Nominating top donors to be ambassadors undermines U.S. diplomacy and national security—and I’ve got a plan to end this practice. https://t.co/wb8fnVZtaY
Michael Bloomberg may think he doesn't need people to win this election—he just needs bags of money.

He’s wrong. That's why I'm investing in meeting thousands of voters, taking over 85,000 selfies, and building a grassroots movement that will fight for big, structural change. https://t.co/DZftlFvyqi
Experts agree: Broad student debt cancellation would supercharge economic growth by freeing a generation crushed by debt. Candidates who oppose it should explain why punishing young people matters more than promoting home ownership and business creation. https://t.co/9UUPYUYWYE

The same communities that have borne the brunt of industrial pollution are also on the front lines of the climate crisis—and extreme weather events could put them at even greater risk. We have to end the climate crisis and clean up Superfund sites. https://t.co/YfFmb6H16S

For months, the people of Hong Kong have taken to the streets to stand up for their rights. This weekend, they went to the ballot box and sent the powerful message that they want to keep their democracy—and Beijing must respect that. https://t.co/tEvUKsz0zu
Let’s be clear: Our government criminalizes too many things and sends too many people to jail. In a Warren administration, we will: 

☑️ Repeal the 1994 Crime Bill 
☑️ Legalize marijuana
☑️ Undo the legacy of the War on Drugs
☑️ End cash bail and private prisons
History has proven that when working women fight together, they win. The Black women of the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike show the true story of American persistence. https://t.co/9ht7ophMNx
There have been 2,302 mass shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook. We shouldn't have to live like this. But unless we root out corruption in Washington, the gun lobby will always have a veto on any legislation to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/QPx0DtRGIA
I support the students, organizers, and activists demanding accountability on climate action and more at #HarvardYale. Climate change is an existential threat, and we must take bold action to fight this crisis. https://t.co/lm1V6honI4
My heart is with @LucyMcBath today. Jordan Davis should be alive. We must call out the fact that Black Americans have borne the brunt of the gun violence tragedy in our country. I promise to fight my heart out—for justice for Jordan, and to end this epidemic. https://t.co/XbUxZTwpz9

This guy was Mick Mulvaney’s right-hand man in Congress. Now, he has a plum job as a payday loan lobbyist and is cozying up to Mulvaney to advance his clients’ interests.

In a Warren administration, we’ll stand up to lobbyists and the predatory loan industry. https://t.co/ShreGlDn4L
@maddygunawan It was great meeting you, Maddy. Thanks for being in this fight!
Mike Bloomberg is placing $34 million in TV ads in one week—the most of any presidential candidate in history.

That’s one way to pay less under my #WealthTax. Because in a Warren administration, he and his billionaire friends would finally have to pay their fair share. https://t.co/qWHtk37zaM
I’m grateful to have you in this fight, @bjoewolf. Together, we’ll keep fighting to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/eCDVw2Pcys
Unlike other candidates, I don’t host fancy fundraisers, I don’t take money from PACs, and I don’t cozy up to billionaires.

Instead, small-dollar donors are the backbone of our grassroots campaign. Donate whatever you can now, and join the fight! https://t.co/EBLSASRJNB
Donald Trump is a walking, talking conflict of interest. It should be illegal for a president to twist the rules of our government to make themselves richer. Under my anti-corruption bill—the biggest since Watergate—it would be. https://t.co/icKIZvutSv
.@JayInslee is exactly right. The Keystone XL pipeline is a harmful project that locks us into further dependence on some of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet. We need clean energy and protection for tribal lands, not another crummy fossil fuel investment. https://t.co/AfbBYaZJCo

Let’s be clear: It’s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. We must be honest about our history, and do what’s right so that our nation can begin to heal. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Lsl47JezpM
White supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair. Now more than ever, all of us must embrace the lessons of Black history to confront this challenge. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/iPVwOk33HI
Racism props up the rich and powerful, leaving them free to take more power for themselves. And the rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. If we want power, we have to fight for it. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/owktsOca4G
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Yes, there’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.
@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.
@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.
@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!
@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.
@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.
@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.
@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.
@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.
@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.
@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.
@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?
@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.
@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf
@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.
@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.
@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.
@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.
@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!
@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”
@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.
@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.
@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.
@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.
@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.
@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU
@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.
I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we've fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarren
We're live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Tc7WIWuUuk
Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan.
See you soon! https://t.co/YEAPDgA6OI
Climate change is an existential threat—and unless we take urgent action to end this crisis, future generations will face catastrophic consequences. That's why I'm fighting for the #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/zZo5yT1dbP
Big Tech companies are not doing enough to protect our privacy—and they won't until they face real competition and accountability. https://t.co/RQYSpZzkcK
Reproductive rights are economic rights. Reproductive rights are human rights. And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.
@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!
Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3S
The way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll.
Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34K
Awood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAru
I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that.
This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.
Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylC
We're not leaving yet, Atlanta! Join us at @CAU on Thursday, where I'll be sharing the stories of some of the most persistent and fearless fighters, Black women who proved that when working women fight together, they win. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/XDcLiZccSL
To everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

I’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together. https://t.co/6Wir1mdB46
The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7A
I believe that abortion rights are human rights.

I believe that they're also economic rights.

And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. #DemDebate https://t.co/kDrlXSKr4Z
I’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebate
I just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlT
We have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebate
In my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3e
I’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It's time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9y
Abortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebate
When I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebate
Right now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebate
We need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here's what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:
✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k
✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools
✅ $50 billion in HBCUs
✅ Cancel student loan debt
#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqR
Our defense budget is massively bloated—we need to end the cozy relationship between defense contractors and the Pentagon, then pull out a sharp knife and make real cuts. I've got a plan for that. #DemDebate https://t.co/n4M5U2JJjN
All three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has toward military personnel and their families. And I’ve got a plan to honor our promises to our nation’s veterans, service members, military families, and survivors. #DemDebate https://t.co/pyMfCKdTgm
For decades, racist redlining practices blocked Black and Brown families from home ownership and building wealth. My housing plan helps level the playing field for families who were denied wealth-building opportunities. #DemDebate https://t.co/vb84trHx3O
Child care is personal for me. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child. It’ll be free for millions of families, and affordable for all. Use my calculator to see how much your family would save: https://t.co/urL0bLuxrg
Billionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04h
Tens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.
I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.

My #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebate
Let me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:

✔️ Universal Child Care
✔️ Universal pre-k
✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools
✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs
✔️ Cancel student loan debt 

#DemDebate
My #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebate
The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebate
The Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That's what's happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebate
Today’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebate
Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. I stand with @StaceyAbrams—and that's why I have a plan to guarantee the right to vote and end voter suppression. https://t.co/wRvU1FR0yJ
I had a wonderful time meeting Lily and her friend Jenny. Lily donated just $10 and won the @TeamWarren contest to join me at tonight's #DemDebate in Atlanta! Thank you both for being a part of this grassroots movement. https://t.co/lKEgC2KoOv
Big, structural change can't wait. @AyannaPressley and I are fighting for it together. https://t.co/mzr27o2FHE
I called @AdyBarkan to tell him that I'm so grateful to have him on @TeamWarren. I'm going to fight for Ady, Rachael, Carl, and Willow just as hard as I fight for my own family. We're going to make big, structural change, together. https://t.co/vcb8uQInF3
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetimes. In a Warren administration, we’ll root out Washington corruption once and for all.

Will you chip in $3 before the #DemDebate tonight to help our campaign keep fighting? https://t.co/EY02tTB1xF
Desde aumentar el salario mínimo federal hasta combatir la discriminación sistémica y proteger el derecho de las trabajadoras latinas a sindicalizarse: estoy lista para luchar desde el primer día para cerrar la brecha salarial. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/xkPRR5A2Dj https://t.co/kKTW1x7TyJ
It's long past time to close the Latina pay gap, and I've got a plan for that. From raising the federal minimum wage, to fighting systemic discrimination, to protecting Latina workers’ rights to unionize—I'm ready to fight on day one. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/54WDOq56co https://t.co/fgYdvNpscq
37 million Americans didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. 
36 million skipped a recommended test or treatment because of costs. 
40 million didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs.
This should never happen. It's time for #MedicareForAll.
On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we #SayTheirNames, and we re-commit to ending this epidemic. #TDoR https://t.co/6mTLM2grTq
I’m fighting my heart out for Rachael, for Carl, for baby Willow—and for you, @AdyBarkan.

(P.S. Willow: Your dad is an inspiration. I’m so honored to know him, and to fight alongside him for a better future for all.) https://t.co/PUqORwiJda
We wouldn't be this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without activists like @AdyBarkan, who has given his life to ensure that every American gets the medical care they need. I’m grateful down to my toes to be in this fight alongside you, Ady. https://t.co/jAo8dTcaAM
I’m deeply grateful to have your support in this fight, @AdyBarkan. I make this promise to you, to Willow, and to every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. 

We’re going to do this—side by side. Together. https://t.co/rS6PQvdNNB
White nationalist violence is a domestic terrorism threat—and we must treat it like one. I've got a plan to fight white nationalist violence. And when I'm president, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. https://t.co/AkO27jkySX
I'm standing with the Indiana teachers rallying for their schools. We need to invest in public education and our public school teachers. They're fighting for our students, so we should be fighting for them, too. #RedForEd https://t.co/QEzq5MwOlZ
We are facing a Black maternal mortality crisis in America. This is life and death for too many moms and babies. I've got a plan to end this epidemic. Thank you @NVPartnersLV and @StevenHorsford for welcoming me to the Black Community Summit. https://t.co/f6UpP3a1Iu
White nationalism has no place in our country, our White House, or our Congress. Let's start by getting Steve King out of office and electing @JDScholten to replace him. #IA04
I'm proud to fight alongside @AyannaPressley for the big, structural change we need—and so happy to announce that she'll be one of my special guests for my speech in Atlanta on Thursday! https://t.co/xbMgOhMCoS
From the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/AsdbVDKbsc
Our alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyv
I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2W
We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7f
Ultimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.
Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgv
I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bH
My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.
First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw
#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmf
Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6
Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.
Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.
I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.
Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.
Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.
Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.
We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.
But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.
Mother Emanuel AME Church.
Charlottesville.
Tree of Life Synagogue.
El Paso.
Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.
The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePg
Millions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I’ve got a plan to make housing more affordable, protect renters from unjust eviction and discrimination, and invest in healthy and green homes.

Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv
Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization. https://t.co/CLBQLPfTsu

Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm
Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.
Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. A true team with a spirit that’d do us all well.

.@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J
Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC.

As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why.

Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: https://t.co/reTnmcg3xo

The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. https://t.co/dqnvNk9cQR
Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline’s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today: https://t.co/d9zwitUNOa https://t.co/mEbwKCDUiP
Here’s a worthwhile Sunday read: “…nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.” https://t.co/tpdMZ9hJoE
I’ve always been proud of what this team accomplished during my administration. But more than what we did, I’m proud of how they’re continuing to fight for an America that’s better. https://t.co/0cfDltjueP
Economist Raj Chetty is not only identifying the decline in opportunity we’ve seen in recent decades—but trying to reverse it. Inequality, like many problems we face, is as vast as it is complex. But this article left me a little more hopeful: https://t.co/CcsXpVVfkP
Here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: A new study on the Medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the Affordable Care Act—and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms: https://t.co/Lj4g7lGFnq
In America, we don’t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it’s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtG
#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. There, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better. https://t.co/fKgrVRiHhc
I have a good feeling about these Chicago @UrbanAlliance interns. Thanks for letting me spend yesterday afternoon with you—you’re going to go on to do incredible things and make many people proud. In fact, you already have. https://t.co/ZjzFQmBQqm
The @ObamaFoundation is helping a new generation of leaders make their mark, and there’s an extraordinary group gathering this week for Obama Leaders: Africa. Their work will help unlock the incredible promise of the continent—and make the world better for all of us. https://t.co/rnPHn9UuEn
Proud to rep America’s best team! Congrats @USWNT and thanks for being such a strong inspiration for women and girls—and everybody—all across the country. https://t.co/9Gp6UTZhEE
Yes! Fourth star. Back to back. Congrats to the record breakers on the @USWNT, an incredible team that’s always pushing themselves—and the rest of us—to be even better. Love this team. #OneNationOneTeam
Happy Fourth of July, everybody! This is always a great day in the Obama family: a chance to celebrate America—and Malia’s birthday, too. Hope all of you are able to get some time with friends, family, and fireworks. https://t.co/Gn9kVCCnuf
I’m admittedly biased, but this article gibes with my experience about what all of us might take away from the “aloha spirit.” https://t.co/TCgvZYzuHe
Congrats to the USWNT! A great performance from a great team—looking forward to Sunday. #OneNationOneTeam
No one changes the world alone. That’s why the @ObamaFoundation is connecting emerging leaders from South Africa to Singapore to the South Side of Chicago—so they can change the world together. Read my reflection on our second year: https://t.co/ly3en2Neu4
The most important job in our democracy is citizen. If you’re tired of politicians manipulating maps and ignoring the will of voters, I hope you’ll sign @allontheline’s Citizen Commitment today: https://t.co/CUAaoAGY6z
50 years ago, history was written at the Stonewall Inn when New York's LGBT community stood up, spoke out, and started a movement. In 2016 I was proud to designate it as a national monument—a reminder the arc of our history is an arc of progress as long as we keep pushing for it. https://t.co/xyvYfuoJwK
What a gift to come across this interview with Julia “Hurricane” Hawkins. I’m as grateful for her life advice as I am impressed by her 100-meter dash time. https://t.co/8lc9Cimqyt
Now we’re talking! Congrats to Team USA for moving on, and thanks for continuing to make us all proud. #USA https://t.co/DVkKBfU6wA
On Juneteenth, we celebrate our capacity to make real the promise of our founding, that thing inside each of us that says America is not yet finished, that compels all of us to fight for justice and equality until this country we love more closely aligns with our highest ideals. https://t.co/2XAKRuRrbG
Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: https://t.co/kSkLHbfnc3
This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn’t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96B7fkBM4u
Yes we can, Greta. I’m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. https://t.co/sUBwC0uNW8
Happy Father’s Day to Charles, one of our @ObamaFoundation Fellows, and all the dads at Fathers’ Uplift. Today, we’re celebrating fathers like these who provide a powerful example—not only for their kids, but for the rest of us, too. https://t.co/GJsxi8DozY
The @USWNT is something to smile about. It was great to celebrate with them back in 2015 and I'm excited to root them on in their drive to earn their fourth star. Best of luck to these champions for equality, on and off the field. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/AHcHGATy5S
Six years ago, David Ortiz's spirit and resolve helped us all begin to heal from the Boston Marathon bombing. Today, I want to join many others in wishing him a speedy recovery of his own. Get well soon, Papi. https://t.co/9orpBgnVI5
Last week, it was Virginia Beach. But day after day and year after year, too many families and communities are shattered by senseless gun violence. We can't get numb to this. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, pledge to speak out, #WearOrange — and vote — to protect lives.
You've got a lot to be proud of, Jiwandeep. Thanks for everything you do to make this country a little more equal. Turban looks great, by the way. Happy Pride Month, everybody! https://t.co/SO7mgnOkgl
What a life. American history has always been driven by visionaries like Leah Chase—and all the men and women who worked and ate at Dooky Chase’s over the years—folks who serve up progress one bowl of gumbo at a time. https://t.co/2LpuIbxvHk https://t.co/Y4i5snKjn7
A story worth sharing: Twelve years ago, Brian joined my first presidential campaign. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with ALS and launched @iamalsorg to find a cure. Brian and Sandra wake up every day believing that we can win this fight—and that makes me hopeful, too. https://t.co/eETCgFnLgP

Great to get out there and take a few cuts at the plate yesterday—I had a blast with all these extraordinary young people. Thanks for letting me drop in and thanks to the Nationals Youth Academy for the outstanding work you do to support youth in DC. https://t.co/GKRMd8kZxm
Here’s a great story: While we’ve still got a lot of work to do to make college affordable for everyone, that didn’t stop Robert F. Smith from seizing an opportunity to make a difference. He’s erasing the student loan debt for this year’s @Morehouse grads. https://t.co/I3X38Pbpjz
Happy Mother's Day to the most caring, brilliant, funny, and grounded woman I know—a perfect role model not just for our daughters, but so many others. Love you, @MichelleObama. https://t.co/liWmYaEPVk
As part of the @ObamaFoundation, moms like Dr. Mwansa Ketty Lubeya are answering the call for change—and raising the next generation of leaders while they’re at it. https://t.co/llToyKG2Y7
Happy #CollegeSigningDay, everybody! I'm proud of every student out there who's taking the next step in their education. It's the best thing you can do for yourself and your future. https://t.co/SZQaUG2Zze
Condolences to the family of John Singleton. His seminal work, Boyz n the Hood, remains one of the most searing, loving portrayals of the challenges facing inner-city youth. He opened doors for filmmakers of color to tell powerful stories that have been too often ignored.
Congratulations to the new class of @ObamaFoundation Fellows! Their work in every region of the globe is already making the world better, and I hope this experience helps them make an even bigger impact. https://t.co/azK2Y9Iw5c https://t.co/tuKO1SFhSK

Dominique’s story is a reminder to us that where you’re from shouldn’t define what you can achieve. I’m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. https://t.co/eD95oWrOk4
This generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world. So while this challenge is only getting more urgent, they show us the kind of action it'll take to meet this moment.
And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEI
I met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month. Luisa, the organizer behind the student movement in Germany, says, “It’s our future and we’re not going to stop fighting for it.” https://t.co/hS03PCWYAq
They're people like 16-year-old @GretaThunberg, whose protests at Swedish parliament sparked a movement. Inspired by Greta's action, Fridays for Future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate. https://t.co/un7nBhEF8i
Young people all over the world are leading the way in the fight to protect our planet because they know their future depends on it. This Earth Day, I want to celebrate the courageous, committed young leaders who are stepping up to save the one planet we've got.

The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka.
Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. https://t.co/SpMEvv1BzB
Congratulations, Tiger! To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit, and determination.
Another good story worth sharing: From one "kid from Akron" to a new generation of Akron kids, some remarkable early achievements at @IPROMISESchool. Great work, @KingJames—and even better work by those students. Proud to be a witness to their success: https://t.co/ctWfKnA5GL

Here’s a story about people doing good that's worth sharing: @BradPaisley and his wife @Kimwilliamspais saw food insecurity in Nashville and decided to do something about it. They just broke ground on a free grocery store to help families in need: https://t.co/o6pcAApZsm
Great to see Chicago’s historic mayoral race between two highly qualified candidates. Congrats to our next mayor, Lori Lightfoot—and Toni Preckwinkle campaigned hard and did us proud. I know that with our city’s heart and Lori’s leadership, Chicago’s best days are still ahead.
Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know “Finding My Voice” will inspire others to lift their voices, too. https://t.co/nWTBDByMoz
Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress—it's a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who’ve taken the torch. This group is going to be driving progress for a long time to come. https://t.co/W5dDlDtNzE

In 2011, I visited the tiny town of Moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather Falmouth Kearney lived his early life. I'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the Irish people. Happy St. Patrick's Day! -Barack O’Bama https://t.co/abDtarFbR5
Michelle and I send our condolences to the people of New Zealand. We grieve with you and the Muslim community. All of us must stand against hatred in all its forms.

Preethi, Alice, and Sefora are just three of many @ObamaFoundation leaders who remind us what International Women’s Day is all about: imagining a world free of artificial ceilings for the next generation—and doing the hard work to get us there.
And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/cRb4EKcrvv
.@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she’s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. https://t.co/jNIiKIAZaO
.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the https://t.co/3RwHe5Razz Foundation, she’s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India—and beyond. https://t.co/TKuAKVL5Y1
On International Women’s Day, I’m reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. And I’m celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today.
It’s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair—everywhere—because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. Join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering: https://t.co/d7TYE8u0CD. https://t.co/rKchS3ltLI

I’ve always loved basketball because it’s about building a team that’s equal to more than the sum of its parts. Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. https://t.co/lghcLaUN9a
Happy Valentine’s Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It’s true; she does get down to Motown. https://t.co/uypbZsEiqB
In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them.
Don’t be sad it’s over, be proud it taught us so much. Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.
Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.
My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: https://t.co/gjBYHHImzB
We lost two great Americans today – Frank Robinson and John Dingell – citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field.
As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson’s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. https://t.co/Fl9aDxqcGi
The @ObamaFoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what’s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. https://t.co/hFAMzW7tBq
I’ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life’s most persistent and urgent question: "What are you doing for others?" Let’s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.
I knew it way back then and I’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uC9J4
In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’ll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody!
I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9
Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ
Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd
Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO
As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I’m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year.
As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL
Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/LKLqlYfFUw

As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/RMJgrWQhP2
No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I’m going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. https://t.co/8mHMsXGY0g
Happy Hanukkah! Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours.

Of course, @MichelleObama’s my wife, so I’m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise – one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE
Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who’s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who’ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk
To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend.
Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn
Today is the day. Today, it’s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. https://t.co/6xdMbKhwkr
If you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. Go vote! https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX
When you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance.
When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment – and make sure they’re paid equally.
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen.
Tomorrow’s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot.
Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP

Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power — use it!

We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.

When Members of Congress take the oath of office, we become custodians of the Constitution. We must uphold our duty to #DefendOurDemocracy.
We legislate. We investigate. We litigate. And yesterday, we had an important victory in our lawsuit to confirm Congress’s right to perform oversight, as the Court of Appeals ruled that the President’s financial records should be turned over to the Congress.
President Trump’s efforts to cover up his betrayal of his oath of office almost make the things Nixon did look small.
We are closely following updates regarding the school shooting in Santa Clarita. Thankful for courageous first responders working to save lives &amp; protect the community. What will it take for Republicans to stop blocking efforts to #EndGunViolence?

The American people don’t need a grim reaper.
 
They need leaders who will #EndGunViolence, #SaveTheNet, and reinstate the protections found in #VAWA.
 
It’s time for Senate Republicans to get to work.

I’m sure a little encouragement from the President wouldn’t hurt.
The House has already passed these and many more, with passage of H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, coming soon as well. And yet Mitch McConnell wants to brag to his donors that he is the “Grim Reaper” instead of passing them.
H.R. 582 would #RaiseTheWage for workers across the country – reinvigorating the middle class &amp; strengthening our economy.
 
By passing the #ClimateActionNow Act, we will confront the Climate Crisis, something young people around the world are rightly demanding.
Some key examples?
 
H.R. 7, the #PaycheckFairness Act, would ensure equal pay for women nationwide.
 
Meanwhile, the #ForThePeople Act would enact the most ambitious set of democracy reforms and ethics standards in a generation.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The scores of bills we’ve passed aren’t busy work.
 
If passed into law, they will improve the lives of Americans across the country &amp; build a better future for generations to come.
 
But the @SenateGOP has made the cynical decision to ignore it all.
.@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Washington want you to think Democrats can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.
 
But we’ve been fighting #ForThePeople since Day One.
 
The House-passed legislation piling up outside @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office proves it. https://t.co/vgb0QajcaW

We’ve learned so much about Trump’s months-long campaign to pressure Ukraine because military veterans &amp; his own national security aides stood up to tell the truth. They put their country ahead of everything else. It’s not too late for Republicans in Congress to do the same.

Republicans face a simple question: is the president allowed to pressure a foreign country into interfering in our elections?

The President's Chief of Staff says there’s “no cover-up.”

But President Trump’s:

State Department
Department of Defense
OMB
Energy Department
&amp; Vice President

Are all defying lawful subpoenas &amp; document requests.

If they have nothing to hide, why not comply? #TruthExposed

Read my full statement with @SenSchumer here: https://t.co/MPt8xAolQ6
Yesterday, the House sent an overwhelming bipartisan message demanding a clear strategy to defeat ISIS, and the Senate should do the same immediately.
This sham ceasefire does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS from prisoners from escaping, and shows the President’s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS.
.@realDonaldTrump is flailing. Reversing sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America’s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike.
For 47 years, the #CleanWaterAct has safeguarded our children’s clean water. But since Day One, the Trump Admin has given big special interests free rein to poison our communities &amp; threaten families' health. @HouseDemocrats are ending this corruption &amp; fighting #ForThePeople.

As we find ourselves in a situation where the President gave a green light to the Turks to bomb and effectively unleashed ISIS, we must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting.
Next, we must put together the strongest bipartisan, bicameral sanctions package similar to the bipartisan bill the House is advancing.
Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President’s dangerous decision in Syria immediately.
The departure of the Acting Homeland Security Secretary is the latest sign of this Administration’s failed leadership, which has worsened the humanitarian situation at the border, and injected pain and tragedy into countless lives. https://t.co/XvIERZL1qF

Amazon made $11,200,000,000 in profits last year.

Its federal income tax bill: ZERO.

It is simply not true that we cannot afford to invest in housing or health care or education.

We will make massive corporations finally pay their fair share.

You don't get a bill when you drop your kid off at school.

You don't pull out your credit card when you call the fire department.

It's time to do the same for health care by passing Medicare for All and ensure no one leaves the hospital with insurmountable debt. https://t.co/vNj1t574H6

The primary goal of a criminal justice system should not be punishment, but whenever possible, rehabilitation.

When I am president, we will no longer spend $80 billion locking up more people than any other nation.

Our goal will be to reduce our incarcerated population by half.

In just the past week our campaign has been endorsed by @UTLAnow, @NationalNurses, @CAYoungDems, @RightsNH and @RightsVT along with dozens of elected officials.

Dental care is a human right.
Mental health care is a human right.
Reproductive health care is a human right.

That is why they’re covered under Medicare for All.
I'm honored to receive @CAYoungDems' endorsement.

Young people are far, far more powerful than the establishment allows them to think they are.

Our campaign is about recognizing that power and working with young people everywhere to achieve justice. https://t.co/uggqHEE3mu
Are you prepared to stand up for the undocumented?

We're told we can't afford to invest in the housing, health care and education our people need.

Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate
Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant.
More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate

Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate

@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be.
I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level. https://t.co/1CAhAjKEju

Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.

The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.

This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.

We cannot turn a blind eye to the atrocities President Trump continues to carry out at the border. This is not who we are. https://t.co/KhV9ds0hNy
I will always choose hope over fear. https://t.co/InWLyqOPpL
You shouldn't be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Under my plan, you will be able to keep them. https://t.co/lJZ9fvPWeV
This decision puts the health of the American people at risk — it’s unacceptable. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and choose science over fiction once again. https://t.co/YqVaGecPgQ
First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy.
We have to lead the world by our example and make clear that human rights, civil rights, and civil liberties matter to us. https://t.co/Ma26IxrInO
Every American deserves access to affordable, quality health care, and Obamacare’s open enrollment is happening now. If you are uninsured, want to change your plan, or know someone who needs health care, visit https://t.co/2Ls3d8icpE to #GetCovered. https://t.co/3fEF3GKn5d
The next president will face an enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America’s foreign policy and salvaging our reputation.

I'm the only candidate in this race ready for that job on day one — and 133 top foreign policy officials agree. https://t.co/4c2Le1VIJV
Change starts at the local level — I learned that firsthand as a 28-year-old on the New Castle County Council. On #NationalRunforOfficeDay, I'm asking you to join me and run for something. There is too much at stake in 2020 to sit on the sidelines. https://t.co/cEgKOoVhVI
President Trump's erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our national security and set our world on edge. Every day that he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States. https://t.co/QcUR5hVCdJ
Every worker should have the chance to join a union which bargains to ensure they get paid a living wage and have protections against sexual harassment. That's why I'm proud to stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking in Detroit and across the country today. https://t.co/r0y6uDM2na
Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist threats. It is intolerable that Israeli civilians live their lives under the constant fear of rocket attacks. That's why our administration was such a strong supporter of Israel's life-saving Iron Dome. https://t.co/aQOUdKZqq7
DREAMers should be treated like the Americans that they are. It's past time for Congress to provide a pathway to citizenship and a fair shot at the American dream. #HomeIsHere https://t.co/9CcEn8BUsm

DREAMers know more about what it means to be an American than you ever will. https://t.co/tPP4SED7iE
As president, I will ensure DREAMers are recognized as the Americans they are. In the meantime, the Supreme Court should overturn Donald Trump’s cruel decision so that DREAMers can continue to live fully in the only country they have ever known. Their #HomeIsHere.
I just finished tonight’s CNN Town Hall, where I laid out my vision for our future and how I’ll deliver real progress for working families.

I know we can defeat Donald Trump and take back this country, but we can’t do it without your help. Chip in today: https://t.co/x0ZyWHk0rC https://t.co/uw1YulnN2N
Donald Trump has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation. He should be impeached. https://t.co/4YWvi0HLxh
At tonight's @CNN Town Hall in Iowa, I laid out my bold vision for the country and why I'm the best candidate in this race to beat Donald Trump and unite our nation.

If you liked what you heard, join our team and let's get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCAUzju
Looking forward to joining @ErinBurnett for tonight’s town hall in Iowa to discuss what’s at stake in this election and why I’m running for president. Tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live.
Our veterans and their families represent the absolute best that our country has to offer. I had the honor of spending Veterans Day in Iowa with a few of them. https://t.co/ziNM4qRHL2
The campaign trail is always more fun when you join, @DrBiden. What a great weekend in New Hampshire! https://t.co/5zX5CZjM3N
President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families. 

As president, I will meet our sacred obligation. https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.

Thank you to all who have served — on Veterans Day and every day. https://t.co/SQBUj8nwmw
I understand the sleepless nights, wondering if your deployed child is safe, and all the added sacrifices military families face because their loved one chose selfless service.

As president, I'll take care of our troops and their families. https://t.co/iNuNHlPsg1
Less than 1% of our population risks everything to protect our country — the other 99% of us owe them more than we could ever repay. #VeteransDay https://t.co/ChF786cRlO
Today, I’m releasing my plan to ensure our veterans receive what they deserve: our respect and enduring gratitude, and the benefits they have earned.  

Read my full plan: https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
The most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by the men and women who defend our nation at war. Veterans Day offers us a moment to reflect on that obligation, and to recommit ourselves to all that it truly means. https://t.co/X0YAR8r3Xj
Together we can, and will, make Donald Trump a one-term president.
We don’t say it enough — Barack Obama was a great president. And I’m proud to have worked alongside him. https://t.co/5pIZxkNxyj
HBCUs and MSIs play a vital role in our communities. As president, I’ll invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success.

The ACA was, and is, a big deal. It took generations of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done. 

I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat.
There is no denying the devastating effects climate change has on our planet — we need to take action. 

As president, I’ll lead the world in addressing the climate emergency. Read my plan at https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo.

Thirty years ago today, the people of Berlin tore down a wall and vanquished a dictatorship. We must not forget the lessons of 1989. The United States must reclaim its mantle as the champion of democracy. The stakes are simply too high. https://t.co/3LkGwfzp6U
Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them. https://t.co/jtOPJDnE30
My plan to build on Obamacare will expand health care coverage and lower costs — without raising taxes on the middle class.

Proponents of Medicare for All can't say the same. Read my full plan: https://t.co/ysfLJK0u9o
A fresh Fall day in New Hampshire spent serving chili to our nation’s finest — firefighters. https://t.co/9BRPyeDkLk
Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.
Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7
This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.
25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education.
President Trump’s trade war is reckless, and hurting our farmers every day. https://t.co/l1BIi9ffHm
It’s official — we’re on the ballot in New Hampshire.

Every kid deserves a quality education and every family deserves to live in a safe, healthy community. That's why I support the California #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst initiative that will make corporations pay their fair share and invest in our communities to help them thrive.
I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we unite this country, America’s best days still lie ahead.

If you agree, chip in today: https://t.co/ybhgvXSyRD
I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.
As California continues to burn, President Trump wants to withhold critical aid and abandon our firefighters when they need our support the most. It's reckless and cruel.

We must act now on climate change and support our firefighters and those affected by this disaster. https://t.co/EahL0fozXo
The courage and determination of folks like @fred_guttenberg have turned the fight for gun safety reform from a cause to a movement.

Together, we will beat the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/IeJ4yOQ16q
Donald Trump wants to talk about corruption? That’s rich coming from the most corrupt president in modern history.

We’ve come too far with the Affordable Care Act to tear it down and start over. Building on Obamacare with a new public option is the best way to lower costs and achieve universal coverage. https://t.co/QbdijSL0se
Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security.
Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House.
Last night's results showed that Democrats can take back our country, starting with Virginia, and begin the hard work of growing a stronger, more inclusive middle class and restoring the soul of our nation.

Chip in to help us take back the White House: https://t.co/Z9v6FGZH0r
I'm running for president to unite this country. There's nothing we cannot do if we do it together. https://t.co/RnwM8UEVUq

Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform.
Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on &amp; off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL &amp; @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program.
Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness.
The U.S. is the strongest nation in the world not just because of the example of our power, but also because of the power of our example.

He should release his taxes or shut up about corruption. https://t.co/7NrKkagZlt
As the climate crisis worsens each day and California burns and Iowa floods, Trump continues to abandon science and our international leadership. He just notified the United Nations of our official withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. It's shameful. https://t.co/5UikQrsS3u
President Trump has turned his back on those he promised to help. He thinks he’s being tough with his trade war, but he’s really being reckless. And American workers are paying the price. 

I will ensure our policies put American workers first. https://t.co/oui5atVxXl
A country that ignores the threat to the very survival of this planet isn’t just troubled — it’s morally bankrupt.

We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and take urgent action to address the climate emergency.
Is anyone surprised that all it takes is a $100 saw to breach Trump’s wall? This whole exercise was a stunt and a sham from the beginning. The only thing the wall has succeeded in doing is tarnishing the image of our nation in the eyes of the world. https://t.co/9d8lNoCEth
This is a dangerous decision by the Trump Administration. We should be strengthening our clean water protections and holding polluters accountable for their actions — not loosening restrictions on toxic waste. https://t.co/asV8E9gCLb

Not me. Our campaign is funded by grassroots donors like you. Will you pitch in now? https://t.co/1tDuvv0GYu
Google recently hired a notorious union-busting firm—and yesterday, fired four employees who were organizing their colleagues and holding Google accountable. I stand with Rebecca Rivers and her colleagues. I’ll always fight to protect workers’ rights. https://t.co/dUIsEd58jY

Dream big, fight hard, put on your sweatshirt, and let’s get to work! https://t.co/JP6wo9OkNp
Yup, I’m tired of “Woe Is Me” billionaires too, @TrevorNoah. My #WealthTax will help families afford child care, college, and free an entire generation from student loan debt—and the billionaires will be just fine. https://t.co/JrkfTPqkt8
Some billionaires figured it might be cheaper to run for president than pay my #WealthTax. Well they don’t have the power of a grassroots movement—and in our democracy, I believe in the power of people over money. https://t.co/tDo1Rjg4WM
Fighting for the #GreenNewDeal isn't just about fighting climate change. It's a commitment to building a better future for the working people of our country by creating millions of good union jobs. We can’t fight climate change with a low-wage economy.
We need to build a new farm economy that is truly open to all. I’ve listened to Black farmers and updated my plan to reflect their experiences. We must root out structural racism to ensure Black farmers succeed. https://t.co/Y9AUKDxHDy
We need bold action now to pass the #GreenNewDeal, build a green new economy, and defeat the climate crisis—and I've got a plan for that. I'm proud to work alongside groups like @SunriseMvmt to build the grassroots movement we need to fight climate change. https://t.co/GHJKDCloow
After my daddy's heart attack, he couldn't work for a while. So my mother got a minimum wage job—and that job saved our house. She was scared, but she found the strength to do what needed to be done to save our family. https://t.co/oeMFWT4Jq5

Let’s be clear: Our government criminalizes too many things and sends too many people to jail. In a Warren administration, we will: 

☑️ Repeal the 1994 Crime Bill 
☑️ Legalize marijuana
☑️ Undo the legacy of the War on Drugs
☑️ End cash bail and private prisons

@maddygunawan It was great meeting you, Maddy. Thanks for being in this fight!
Mike Bloomberg is placing $34 million in TV ads in one week—the most of any presidential candidate in history.

@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Yes, there’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.
@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.
@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.
@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!
@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.
@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.
@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.
@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.
@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.
@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.
@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.
@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?
@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.
@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf
@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.
@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.
@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.
@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.
@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!
@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”
@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.
@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.
@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.
@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.
@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.
@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU
@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.
I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we've fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarren
We're live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Tc7WIWuUuk
Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan.
See you soon! https://t.co/YEAPDgA6OI
Climate change is an existential threat—and unless we take urgent action to end this crisis, future generations will face catastrophic consequences. That's why I'm fighting for the #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/zZo5yT1dbP
Big Tech companies are not doing enough to protect our privacy—and they won't until they face real competition and accountability. https://t.co/RQYSpZzkcK
Reproductive rights are economic rights. Reproductive rights are human rights. And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.
@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!
Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3S
The way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll.
Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34K
Awood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAru
I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that.
This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.
Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylC
We're not leaving yet, Atlanta! Join us at @CAU on Thursday, where I'll be sharing the stories of some of the most persistent and fearless fighters, Black women who proved that when working women fight together, they win. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/XDcLiZccSL
To everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

I’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together. https://t.co/6Wir1mdB46
The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7A
I believe that abortion rights are human rights.

I believe that they're also economic rights.

And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. #DemDebate https://t.co/kDrlXSKr4Z
I’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebate
I just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlT
We have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebate
In my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3e
I’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It's time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9y
Abortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebate
When I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebate
Right now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebate
We need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here's what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:
✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k
✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools
✅ $50 billion in HBCUs
✅ Cancel student loan debt
#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqR
Our defense budget is massively bloated—we need to end the cozy relationship between defense contractors and the Pentagon, then pull out a sharp knife and make real cuts. I've got a plan for that. #DemDebate https://t.co/n4M5U2JJjN
All three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has toward military personnel and their families. And I’ve got a plan to honor our promises to our nation’s veterans, service members, military families, and survivors. #DemDebate https://t.co/pyMfCKdTgm
For decades, racist redlining practices blocked Black and Brown families from home ownership and building wealth. My housing plan helps level the playing field for families who were denied wealth-building opportunities. #DemDebate https://t.co/vb84trHx3O
Child care is personal for me. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child. It’ll be free for millions of families, and affordable for all. Use my calculator to see how much your family would save: https://t.co/urL0bLuxrg
Billionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04h
Tens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.
I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.

My #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebate
Let me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:

✔️ Universal Child Care
✔️ Universal pre-k
✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools
✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs
✔️ Cancel student loan debt 

#DemDebate
My #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebate
The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebate
The Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That's what's happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebate
Today’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebate
Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. I stand with @StaceyAbrams—and that's why I have a plan to guarantee the right to vote and end voter suppression. https://t.co/wRvU1FR0yJ
I had a wonderful time meeting Lily and her friend Jenny. Lily donated just $10 and won the @TeamWarren contest to join me at tonight's #DemDebate in Atlanta! Thank you both for being a part of this grassroots movement. https://t.co/lKEgC2KoOv
Big, structural change can't wait. @AyannaPressley and I are fighting for it together. https://t.co/mzr27o2FHE
I called @AdyBarkan to tell him that I'm so grateful to have him on @TeamWarren. I'm going to fight for Ady, Rachael, Carl, and Willow just as hard as I fight for my own family. We're going to make big, structural change, together. https://t.co/vcb8uQInF3
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in our lifetimes. In a Warren administration, we’ll root out Washington corruption once and for all.

Will you chip in $3 before the #DemDebate tonight to help our campaign keep fighting? https://t.co/EY02tTB1xF
Desde aumentar el salario mínimo federal hasta combatir la discriminación sistémica y proteger el derecho de las trabajadoras latinas a sindicalizarse: estoy lista para luchar desde el primer día para cerrar la brecha salarial. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/xkPRR5A2Dj https://t.co/kKTW1x7TyJ
It's long past time to close the Latina pay gap, and I've got a plan for that. From raising the federal minimum wage, to fighting systemic discrimination, to protecting Latina workers’ rights to unionize—I'm ready to fight on day one. #LatinaEqualPayDay https://t.co/54WDOq56co https://t.co/fgYdvNpscq
37 million Americans didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. 
36 million skipped a recommended test or treatment because of costs. 
40 million didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs.
This should never happen. It's time for #MedicareForAll.
On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we #SayTheirNames, and we re-commit to ending this epidemic. #TDoR https://t.co/6mTLM2grTq
I’m fighting my heart out for Rachael, for Carl, for baby Willow—and for you, @AdyBarkan.

(P.S. Willow: Your dad is an inspiration. I’m so honored to know him, and to fight alongside him for a better future for all.) https://t.co/PUqORwiJda
We wouldn't be this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without activists like @AdyBarkan, who has given his life to ensure that every American gets the medical care they need. I’m grateful down to my toes to be in this fight alongside you, Ady. https://t.co/jAo8dTcaAM
I’m deeply grateful to have your support in this fight, @AdyBarkan. I make this promise to you, to Willow, and to every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own. 

We’re going to do this—side by side. Together. https://t.co/rS6PQvdNNB
White nationalist violence is a domestic terrorism threat—and we must treat it like one. I've got a plan to fight white nationalist violence. And when I'm president, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. https://t.co/AkO27jkySX
I'm standing with the Indiana teachers rallying for their schools. We need to invest in public education and our public school teachers. They're fighting for our students, so we should be fighting for them, too. #RedForEd https://t.co/QEzq5MwOlZ
We are facing a Black maternal mortality crisis in America. This is life and death for too many moms and babies. I've got a plan to end this epidemic. Thank you @NVPartnersLV and @StevenHorsford for welcoming me to the Black Community Summit. https://t.co/f6UpP3a1Iu
White nationalism has no place in our country, our White House, or our Congress. Let's start by getting Steve King out of office and electing @JDScholten to replace him. #IA04
I'm proud to fight alongside @AyannaPressley for the big, structural change we need—and so happy to announce that she'll be one of my special guests for my speech in Atlanta on Thursday! https://t.co/xbMgOhMCoS
From the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/AsdbVDKbsc
Our alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyv
I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2W
We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7f
Ultimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.
Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgv
I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bH
My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.
First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw
#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmf
Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6
Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.
Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.
I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.
Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.
Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.
Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.
We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.
But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.
Mother Emanuel AME Church.
Charlottesville.
Tree of Life Synagogue.
El Paso.
Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.
The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePg
Millions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I’ve got a plan to make housing more affordable, protect renters from unjust eviction and discrimination, and invest in healthy and green homes. 

Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to live. https://t.co/rWDJr8EXIF
The way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win! https://t.co/NyOX0QhIhs
Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to live—and I'm committed to fighting to protect tenants’ rights. Thank you @MakeRoadActNV and @CPDAction for joining me today to discuss my plan to protect and empower renting families! https://t.co/S7PZs8miEB
The forceful removal of @NJWFA State Director @SueAltman from a public hearing is outrageous. I stand with her and @WorkingFamilies. https://t.co/DEaJiC6iQA
Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: "Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity." https://t.co/AZC9kpqoqx
Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv
Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization. https://t.co/CLBQLPfTsu
Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. Can’t wait to join them in Malaysia next month. https://t.co/jrure7D6Uv
Proud to see Oluwaseun @AyodejiOsowobi in this list. She’s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who’s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation. https://t.co/JSkUnRtaoD
Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt.
This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country https://t.co/rBAMNk0zvb
No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/aHHeNvAisn
Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm
Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.
Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. A true team with a spirit that’d do us all well.
Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm
.@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J
Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC.
Here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu
As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why. It’s a tribute to American leadership—and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you’ll read it. https://t.co/7iUWt76xUw
Like the Beatles said: It’s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! https://t.co/mImRqIYn1R
On National Voter Registration Day, it’s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX — and tell your friends, too.
One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C
That’s what Americans do when others are in need – we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnRcAfNIk2
Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he’d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees.
https://t.co/H6xBIW4Ka0
Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hXu68RPH
As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9PVcwDl
Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs
Yesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaIt
Saw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it—keep it up, David! That’s some creative organizing.
https://t.co/bbkbf7vygr
Training is at the heart of organizing. It’s why I’ve always made it a priority – from my 2008 campaign until now. And it’s why I’m proud to announce @allontheline’s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U. Join us: https://t.co/yrWJ50wSdE https://t.co/HiKvGd2XyE
With summer winding down, here’s a sampling of what Michelle and I have been listening to — some new, some old, some fast, some slow. Hope you enjoy. https://t.co/BS5ri1lvxz
A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else’s life. It can help you find common ground. And it’s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground’s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix. https://t.co/KzkYFqjrFV
Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/JG7Jgu4p9t
Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: https://t.co/reTnmcg3xo

The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. https://t.co/dqnvNk9cQR
Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline’s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today: https://t.co/d9zwitUNOa https://t.co/mEbwKCDUiP
Here’s a worthwhile Sunday read: “…nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.” https://t.co/tpdMZ9hJoE
I’ve always been proud of what this team accomplished during my administration. But more than what we did, I’m proud of how they’re continuing to fight for an America that’s better. https://t.co/0cfDltjueP
Economist Raj Chetty is not only identifying the decline in opportunity we’ve seen in recent decades—but trying to reverse it. Inequality, like many problems we face, is as vast as it is complex. But this article left me a little more hopeful: https://t.co/CcsXpVVfkP
Here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: A new study on the Medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the Affordable Care Act—and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms: https://t.co/Lj4g7lGFnq
In America, we don’t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it’s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtG
#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. There, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better. https://t.co/fKgrVRiHhc
I have a good feeling about these Chicago @UrbanAlliance interns. Thanks for letting me spend yesterday afternoon with you—you’re going to go on to do incredible things and make many people proud. In fact, you already have. https://t.co/ZjzFQmBQqm
The @ObamaFoundation is helping a new generation of leaders make their mark, and there’s an extraordinary group gathering this week for Obama Leaders: Africa. Their work will help unlock the incredible promise of the continent—and make the world better for all of us. https://t.co/rnPHn9UuEn
Proud to rep America’s best team! Congrats @USWNT and thanks for being such a strong inspiration for women and girls—and everybody—all across the country. https://t.co/9Gp6UTZhEE
Yes! Fourth star. Back to back. Congrats to the record breakers on the @USWNT, an incredible team that’s always pushing themselves—and the rest of us—to be even better. Love this team. #OneNationOneTeam
Happy Fourth of July, everybody! This is always a great day in the Obama family: a chance to celebrate America—and Malia’s birthday, too. Hope all of you are able to get some time with friends, family, and fireworks. https://t.co/Gn9kVCCnuf
I’m admittedly biased, but this article gibes with my experience about what all of us might take away from the “aloha spirit.” https://t.co/TCgvZYzuHe
Congrats to the USWNT! A great performance from a great team—looking forward to Sunday. #OneNationOneTeam
No one changes the world alone. That’s why the @ObamaFoundation is connecting emerging leaders from South Africa to Singapore to the South Side of Chicago—so they can change the world together. Read my reflection on our second year: https://t.co/ly3en2Neu4
The most important job in our democracy is citizen. If you’re tired of politicians manipulating maps and ignoring the will of voters, I hope you’ll sign @allontheline’s Citizen Commitment today: https://t.co/CUAaoAGY6z
50 years ago, history was written at the Stonewall Inn when New York's LGBT community stood up, spoke out, and started a movement. In 2016 I was proud to designate it as a national monument—a reminder the arc of our history is an arc of progress as long as we keep pushing for it. https://t.co/xyvYfuoJwK
What a gift to come across this interview with Julia “Hurricane” Hawkins. I’m as grateful for her life advice as I am impressed by her 100-meter dash time. https://t.co/8lc9Cimqyt
Now we’re talking! Congrats to Team USA for moving on, and thanks for continuing to make us all proud. #USA https://t.co/DVkKBfU6wA
On Juneteenth, we celebrate our capacity to make real the promise of our founding, that thing inside each of us that says America is not yet finished, that compels all of us to fight for justice and equality until this country we love more closely aligns with our highest ideals. https://t.co/2XAKRuRrbG
Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: https://t.co/kSkLHbfnc3
This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn’t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96B7fkBM4u
Yes we can, Greta. I’m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. https://t.co/sUBwC0uNW8
Happy Father’s Day to Charles, one of our @ObamaFoundation Fellows, and all the dads at Fathers’ Uplift. Today, we’re celebrating fathers like these who provide a powerful example—not only for their kids, but for the rest of us, too. https://t.co/GJsxi8DozY
The @USWNT is something to smile about. It was great to celebrate with them back in 2015 and I'm excited to root them on in their drive to earn their fourth star. Best of luck to these champions for equality, on and off the field. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/AHcHGATy5S
Six years ago, David Ortiz's spirit and resolve helped us all begin to heal from the Boston Marathon bombing. Today, I want to join many others in wishing him a speedy recovery of his own. Get well soon, Papi. https://t.co/9orpBgnVI5
Last week, it was Virginia Beach. But day after day and year after year, too many families and communities are shattered by senseless gun violence. We can't get numb to this. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, pledge to speak out, #WearOrange — and vote — to protect lives.
You've got a lot to be proud of, Jiwandeep. Thanks for everything you do to make this country a little more equal. Turban looks great, by the way. Happy Pride Month, everybody! https://t.co/SO7mgnOkgl
What a life. American history has always been driven by visionaries like Leah Chase—and all the men and women who worked and ate at Dooky Chase’s over the years—folks who serve up progress one bowl of gumbo at a time. https://t.co/2LpuIbxvHk https://t.co/Y4i5snKjn7
A story worth sharing: Twelve years ago, Brian joined my first presidential campaign. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with ALS and launched @iamalsorg to find a cure. Brian and Sandra wake up every day believing that we can win this fight—and that makes me hopeful, too. https://t.co/eETCgFnLgP
Exciting to see the faces of Colombia's future at an @ObamaFoundation roundtable with young leaders in Bogotá. Their creativity, their compassion, and their drive to improve their country are promising signs of what's to come. https://t.co/HrhreUuPMa

Great to get out there and take a few cuts at the plate yesterday—I had a blast with all these extraordinary young people. Thanks for letting me drop in and thanks to the Nationals Youth Academy for the outstanding work you do to support youth in DC. https://t.co/GKRMd8kZxm
Here’s a great story: While we’ve still got a lot of work to do to make college affordable for everyone, that didn’t stop Robert F. Smith from seizing an opportunity to make a difference. He’s erasing the student loan debt for this year’s @Morehouse grads. https://t.co/I3X38Pbpjz
Happy Mother's Day to the most caring, brilliant, funny, and grounded woman I know—a perfect role model not just for our daughters, but so many others. Love you, @MichelleObama. https://t.co/liWmYaEPVk
As part of the @ObamaFoundation, moms like Dr. Mwansa Ketty Lubeya are answering the call for change—and raising the next generation of leaders while they’re at it. https://t.co/llToyKG2Y7
Happy #CollegeSigningDay, everybody! I'm proud of every student out there who's taking the next step in their education. It's the best thing you can do for yourself and your future. https://t.co/SZQaUG2Zze
Condolences to the family of John Singleton. His seminal work, Boyz n the Hood, remains one of the most searing, loving portrayals of the challenges facing inner-city youth. He opened doors for filmmakers of color to tell powerful stories that have been too often ignored.
Congratulations to the new class of @ObamaFoundation Fellows! Their work in every region of the globe is already making the world better, and I hope this experience helps them make an even bigger impact. https://t.co/azK2Y9Iw5c https://t.co/tuKO1SFhSK

Dominique’s story is a reminder to us that where you’re from shouldn’t define what you can achieve. I’m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. https://t.co/eD95oWrOk4
This generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world. So while this challenge is only getting more urgent, they show us the kind of action it'll take to meet this moment.
And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEI
I met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month. Luisa, the organizer behind the student movement in Germany, says, “It’s our future and we’re not going to stop fighting for it.” https://t.co/hS03PCWYAq
They're people like 16-year-old @GretaThunberg, whose protests at Swedish parliament sparked a movement. Inspired by Greta's action, Fridays for Future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate. https://t.co/un7nBhEF8i
Young people all over the world are leading the way in the fight to protect our planet because they know their future depends on it. This Earth Day, I want to celebrate the courageous, committed young leaders who are stepping up to save the one planet we've got.
To all who celebrate today, happy Easter from our family to yours! On this day of rebirth and renewal, let’s recommit to love and serve our brothers and sisters, especially those in need, in every way we can. Have a great day, everybody. https://t.co/BtMyWebGLw
The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka.
Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. https://t.co/SpMEvv1BzB
Congratulations, Tiger! To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit, and determination.
Another good story worth sharing: From one "kid from Akron" to a new generation of Akron kids, some remarkable early achievements at @IPROMISESchool. Great work, @KingJames—and even better work by those students. Proud to be a witness to their success: https://t.co/ctWfKnA5GL
From a big NBA fan, congrats to future Hall of Famers Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki—not just all-time greats but class acts, too.

Here’s a story about people doing good that's worth sharing: @BradPaisley and his wife @Kimwilliamspais saw food insecurity in Nashville and decided to do something about it. They just broke ground on a free grocery store to help families in need: https://t.co/o6pcAApZsm
Great to see Chicago’s historic mayoral race between two highly qualified candidates. Congrats to our next mayor, Lori Lightfoot—and Toni Preckwinkle campaigned hard and did us proud. I know that with our city’s heart and Lori’s leadership, Chicago’s best days are still ahead.
Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know “Finding My Voice” will inspire others to lift their voices, too. https://t.co/nWTBDByMoz
Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress—it's a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who’ve taken the torch. This group is going to be driving progress for a long time to come. https://t.co/W5dDlDtNzE

In 2011, I visited the tiny town of Moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather Falmouth Kearney lived his early life. I'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the Irish people. Happy St. Patrick's Day! -Barack O’Bama https://t.co/abDtarFbR5
Michelle and I send our condolences to the people of New Zealand. We grieve with you and the Muslim community. All of us must stand against hatred in all its forms.

Preethi, Alice, and Sefora are just three of many @ObamaFoundation leaders who remind us what International Women’s Day is all about: imagining a world free of artificial ceilings for the next generation—and doing the hard work to get us there.
And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/cRb4EKcrvv
.@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she’s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. https://t.co/jNIiKIAZaO
.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the https://t.co/3RwHe5Razz Foundation, she’s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India—and beyond. https://t.co/TKuAKVL5Y1
On International Women’s Day, I’m reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. And I’m celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today.
It’s up to all of us as citizens to make sure that the rules of democracy are fair—everywhere—because the next decade of our nation's progress is on the line. Join me and @allontheline in the fight against gerrymandering: https://t.co/d7TYE8u0CD. https://t.co/rKchS3ltLI

I’ve always loved basketball because it’s about building a team that’s equal to more than the sum of its parts. Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court. https://t.co/lghcLaUN9a
Happy Valentine’s Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It’s true; she does get down to Motown. https://t.co/uypbZsEiqB
In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them.
Don’t be sad it’s over, be proud it taught us so much. Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.
Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.
My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: https://t.co/gjBYHHImzB
We lost two great Americans today – Frank Robinson and John Dingell – citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field.
As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson’s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. https://t.co/Fl9aDxqcGi

I’ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life’s most persistent and urgent question: "What are you doing for others?" Let’s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.
I knew it way back then and I’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uC9J4
In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’ll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody!
I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9
Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ
Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd
Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO
As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I’m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year.
As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL
Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/LKLqlYfFUw
There’s no better time than the holidays to give back to your community. Yesterday I got to do just that at @ChildrensHealth.

As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/RMJgrWQhP2
No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I’m going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. https://t.co/8mHMsXGY0g

Of course, @MichelleObama’s my wife, so I’m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise – one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE
Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who’s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who’ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk
To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend.
Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn
Today is the day. Today, it’s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. https://t.co/6xdMbKhwkr
If you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. Go vote! https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX
When you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance.
When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment – and make sure they’re paid equally.
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen.
Tomorrow’s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot.
Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP
Elections matter. You have the power to protect a family’s health care. Make a plan, grab some friends, and vote: https://t.co/rY8Ip1km9p
While we're talking about preexisting conditions, the ACA is the law that finally protected your coverage for preexisting conditions.

Those protections and your health care are absolutely at stake on Tuesday. Vote for Democrats who’ll protect them. https://t.co/BDDmY60u8k
Not sure who and what you can vote for? Head over to https://t.co/SHxg6ael0O to look up your state, learn who's running to represent you, which measures you can help decide, and more. Read up, and get ready to vote on November 6.
Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power — use it! In most states, you don't even have to wait until Election Day to cast a ballot. Find out where you can vote before Nov. 6: https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX https://t.co/hWkFHqi49K
We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.

I’m confident that, together, they’ll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes.

San Francisco Mayor George Moscone &amp; Supervisor Harvey Milk embodied the optimistic, progressive vision of our city. 41 years after they were murdered in a shocking act of brutality, we will never stop advancing their mission to bring about a more caring, inclusive future.

All freedom-loving people in the U.S. and around the world are inspired by yesterday’s historic vote in #HongKong! The people of Hong Kong cast their resounding vote for democratic freedoms and autonomy, which must be fully respected by Beijing.
Reports that more than 100 protestors have been killed by Iranian security forces raise serious concerns. All Iranians should be able to make their voices heard without fear of reprisal. Iran must immediately restore full internet access and allow all to speak out.
Whether calling on @SenateMajLdr McConnell to finally call a vote on life-saving legislation to #EndGunViolence or hearing from young immigration activists, we will never give up our fight #ForThePeople. Here are a few moments that stood out. https://t.co/uOrN7VthNR

The President’s call set off alarms across the White House.

“The US has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say it’s reciprocal.”

“I would like you to do us a favor though.”

“There’s been a lot of talk about Biden’s son.”

When Members of Congress take the oath of office, we become custodians of the Constitution. We must uphold our duty to #DefendOurDemocracy.
We legislate. We investigate. We litigate. And yesterday, we had an important victory in our lawsuit to confirm Congress’s right to perform oversight, as the Court of Appeals ruled that the President’s financial records should be turned over to the Congress.
President Trump’s efforts to cover up his betrayal of his oath of office almost make the things Nixon did look small.
We are closely following updates regarding the school shooting in Santa Clarita. Thankful for courageous first responders working to save lives &amp; protect the community. What will it take for Republicans to stop blocking efforts to #EndGunViolence?

The American people don’t need a grim reaper.
 
They need leaders who will #EndGunViolence, #SaveTheNet, and reinstate the protections found in #VAWA.
 
It’s time for Senate Republicans to get to work.

I’m sure a little encouragement from the President wouldn’t hurt.
The House has already passed these and many more, with passage of H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, coming soon as well. And yet Mitch McConnell wants to brag to his donors that he is the “Grim Reaper” instead of passing them.
H.R. 582 would #RaiseTheWage for workers across the country – reinvigorating the middle class &amp; strengthening our economy.
 
By passing the #ClimateActionNow Act, we will confront the Climate Crisis, something young people around the world are rightly demanding.
Some key examples?
 
H.R. 7, the #PaycheckFairness Act, would ensure equal pay for women nationwide.
 
Meanwhile, the #ForThePeople Act would enact the most ambitious set of democracy reforms and ethics standards in a generation.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The scores of bills we’ve passed aren’t busy work.
 
If passed into law, they will improve the lives of Americans across the country &amp; build a better future for generations to come.
 
But the @SenateGOP has made the cynical decision to ignore it all.
.@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Washington want you to think Democrats can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.
 
But we’ve been fighting #ForThePeople since Day One.
 
The House-passed legislation piling up outside @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office proves it. https://t.co/vgb0QajcaW

Dems will keep fighting the GOP's anti-science agenda &amp; urging Senate to pass #ClimateActionNow.
We’ve learned so much about Trump’s months-long campaign to pressure Ukraine because military veterans &amp; his own national security aides stood up to tell the truth. They put their country ahead of everything else. It’s not too late for Republicans in Congress to do the same.

Yesterday, the House sent an overwhelming bipartisan message demanding a clear strategy to defeat ISIS, and the Senate should do the same immediately.
This sham ceasefire does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS from prisoners from escaping, and shows the President’s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS.
.@realDonaldTrump is flailing. Reversing sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America’s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike.
For 47 years, the #CleanWaterAct has safeguarded our children’s clean water. But since Day One, the Trump Admin has given big special interests free rein to poison our communities &amp; threaten families' health. @HouseDemocrats are ending this corruption &amp; fighting #ForThePeople.

As we find ourselves in a situation where the President gave a green light to the Turks to bomb and effectively unleashed ISIS, we must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting.
Next, we must put together the strongest bipartisan, bicameral sanctions package similar to the bipartisan bill the House is advancing.
Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President’s dangerous decision in Syria immediately.

We are ready to fight for decent, fair wages for women everywhere. #LatinaEqualPayDay
When I ran for Congress we won a seat that had been Republican for decades.

I passed more amendments than any member from 1995 to 2007.

We invested in community health centers, saved pensions and protected farmers.

No matter who we're up against we'll organize and we'll win. https://t.co/9UOaPatmWn
It should be much easier, in Iowa and across the country, for workers to form a union. I’m proud to stand with these Iowans who are standing up for their right to unionize. Together, we’re going to double union membership in my first term.

We are the strongest campaign to defeat Trump. Or Pence. Or whoever the Republicans put up.

Teachers are doing some of the most important work in America. When we are in the White House, we will work to ensure a starting salary of at least $60,000 for every public school teacher.
There are very few people in the country doing more to make Medicare for All a reality than @adybarkan. I'm proud to call him a friend and I look forward to fighting alongside him to guarantee health care for all Americans.
The security officers who keep Downtown Detroit's billion-dollar buildings safe are struggling to support their families. I stand with them as they fight for a voice on the job and the benefits they need. https://t.co/dMpefdTxDw
Teachers shouldn't have to fight for adequate resources for their students. But across the country the #RedforEd movement has shown that when teachers and communities are organized, they can win. To the students, parents and teachers of Indiana, we are with you. https://t.co/iiSn78MuHf
Your $8.99 Netflix subscription is more than the company paid in federal income taxes last year (nothing).

In 1965 the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 20:1.

Over and over, the corporate establishment has tried to convince people that we have no chance.

Well, we just passed 4 million individual contributions—faster than any campaign in history.

That's a pretty powerful movement and we are ready to take on the billionaire class.
Sean is absolutely right. Closing down Minor League teams, like the Vermont Lake Monsters, would be a disaster for baseball fans, workers, and communities across the country. We must protect these teams from corporate greed. https://t.co/g8BZi6HGeH
It’s time the government had the backs of family farmers instead of doing favors for corporate agriculture monopolies. When we are in the White House we will revitalize rural America by fighting for working people and farmers, not big agri-business.

We are the fastest campaign in history to reach 4 million donations.

We are the only campaign with more donations and donors than Trump.

Amazon made $11,200,000,000 in profits last year.

Dental care is a human right.
Mental health care is a human right.
Reproductive health care is a human right.

That is why they’re covered under Medicare for All.

We're told we can't afford to invest in the housing, health care and education our people need.

Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant.

Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate

@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.

Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay

The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.

America is more equal because of Chief Justice Mark Cady. His landmark decision brought marriage equality to Iowa and pushed our nation closer to our highest ideals. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to his loved ones.

This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism. https://t.co/qmyRbxGdiq

Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.

Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer.
President Trump campaigned on repairing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But after countless “Infrastructure Weeks,” he has failed to deliver results. It has to change.

The Affordable Care Act
An assault weapons ban

President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families. 

As president, I will meet our sacred obligation. https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.

☑️ End cash bail and private prisons

Grateful to be in this fight alongside you, @AyannaPressley! https://t.co/gtT6ALL05g
Did I have a plan to get me, @DesusNice, and @TheKidMero out of the escape room? You bet. https://t.co/vSE9kBoJj8
Every presidential candidate should join us in pledging to end the practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors. https://t.co/rD1C3wNVgV
Black history is American history.

The lessons of Black history—from the Atlanta washerwoman's strike, to Dorothy Bolden’s fight for domestic workers—will not be lost.

What an honor to be with @BlackWomxnFor and @AyannaPressley at @CAU last night. https://t.co/J1TEOfY1Qa
This isn’t about drivers’ licenses or the Census. This is another cruel way that the Trump administration and Republicans are working to undercount, underfund, and take political power away from immigrant communities. We must fight back.
https://t.co/3VaJlTUMDy
It's my honor to have @Deb4CongressNM, @KatiePorterOC, and @AyannaPressley as my Campaign Co-Chairs. Big structural change can't wait, and we'll fight for it—together. https://t.co/ZnI2xat8xN
This cruel, unnecessary policy will put asylum seekers at risk. Our laws and our values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. I'll reverse this policy and welcome asylum seekers. https://t.co/1ul4h79BL1
WeWork is laying off 2,400 employees—while its founder walks away with a massive $1.7 billion golden parachute.

This is another example of a rigged and corrupt system. I’m fighting my heart out to put power in the hands of American workers. https://t.co/Zng6gqYk0J
Let’s be clear: It’s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. We must be honest about our history, and do what’s right so that our nation can begin to heal. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Lsl47JezpM
White supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair. Now more than ever, all of us must embrace the lessons of Black history to confront this challenge. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/iPVwOk33HI
Racism props up the rich and powerful, leaving them free to take more power for themselves. And the rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. If we want power, we have to fight for it. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/owktsOca4G
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Yes, there’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.
@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.
@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.
@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!
@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.
@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.
@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.
@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.
@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.
@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.
@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.
@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?
@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.
@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf
@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.
@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.
@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.
@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.
@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!
@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”
@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.
@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.
@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.
@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.
@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.
@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU
@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.
I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we've fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarren
We're live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Tc7WIWuUuk
Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan.

Reproductive rights are economic rights. Reproductive rights are human rights. And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.
@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!
Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3S
The way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll.
Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34K
Awood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAru
I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that.
This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.
Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylC
We're not leaving yet, Atlanta! Join us at @CAU on Thursday, where I'll be sharing the stories of some of the most persistent and fearless fighters, Black women who proved that when working women fight together, they win. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/XDcLiZccSL
To everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

I’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together. https://t.co/6Wir1mdB46
The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7A
I believe that abortion rights are human rights.

I believe that they're also economic rights.

And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. #DemDebate https://t.co/kDrlXSKr4Z
I’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebate
I just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlT
We have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebate
In my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3e
I’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It's time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9y
Abortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebate
When I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebate
Right now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebate
We need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here's what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:
✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k
✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools
✅ $50 billion in HBCUs
✅ Cancel student loan debt
#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqR

For decades, racist redlining practices blocked Black and Brown families from home ownership and building wealth. My housing plan helps level the playing field for families who were denied wealth-building opportunities. #DemDebate https://t.co/vb84trHx3O
Child care is personal for me. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child. It’ll be free for millions of families, and affordable for all. Use my calculator to see how much your family would save: https://t.co/urL0bLuxrg
Billionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04h
Tens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.
I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.

My #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebate
Let me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:

✔️ Universal Child Care
✔️ Universal pre-k
✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools
✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs
✔️ Cancel student loan debt 

#DemDebate
My #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebate
The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebate
The Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That's what's happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebate
Today’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebate
Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. I stand with @StaceyAbrams—and that's why I have a plan to guarantee the right to vote and end voter suppression. https://t.co/wRvU1FR0yJ

37 million Americans didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. 
36 million skipped a recommended test or treatment because of costs. 
40 million didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs.
This should never happen. It's time for #MedicareForAll.
On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we #SayTheirNames, and we re-commit to ending this epidemic. #TDoR https://t.co/6mTLM2grTq
I’m fighting my heart out for Rachael, for Carl, for baby Willow—and for you, @AdyBarkan.

(P.S. Willow: Your dad is an inspiration. I’m so honored to know him, and to fight alongside him for a better future for all.) https://t.co/PUqORwiJda
We wouldn't be this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without activists like @AdyBarkan, who has given his life to ensure that every American gets the medical care they need. I’m grateful down to my toes to be in this fight alongside you, Ady. https://t.co/jAo8dTcaAM
I’m deeply grateful to have your support in this fight, @AdyBarkan. I make this promise to you, to Willow, and to every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own.

White nationalist violence is a domestic terrorism threat—and we must treat it like one. I've got a plan to fight white nationalist violence. And when I'm president, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. https://t.co/AkO27jkySX

White nationalism has no place in our country, our White House, or our Congress. Let's start by getting Steve King out of office and electing @JDScholten to replace him. #IA04

From the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/AsdbVDKbsc
Our alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyv
I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2W
We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7f
Ultimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.
Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgv
I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bH
My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.
First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw
#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmf
Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6
Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.
Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.
I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.
Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.
Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.
Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.
We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.
But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.
Mother Emanuel AME Church.
Charlottesville.
Tree of Life Synagogue.
El Paso.
Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.
The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePg

Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv

Proud to see Oluwaseun @AyodejiOsowobi in this list. She’s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who’s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation. https://t.co/JSkUnRtaoD
Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt.
This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country https://t.co/rBAMNk0zvb
No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/aHHeNvAisn
Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm
Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.
Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. A true team with a spirit that’d do us all well.
Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm
.@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J
Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC.
Here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu
As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why. It’s a tribute to American leadership—and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you’ll read it. https://t.co/7iUWt76xUw
Like the Beatles said: It’s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! https://t.co/mImRqIYn1R
On National Voter Registration Day, it’s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX — and tell your friends, too.
One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C
That’s what Americans do when others are in need – we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnRcAfNIk2
Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he’d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees.
https://t.co/H6xBIW4Ka0
Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hXu68RPH
As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9PVcwDl
Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs
Yesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaIt
Saw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it—keep it up, David! That’s some creative organizing.
https://t.co/bbkbf7vygr
Training is at the heart of organizing. It’s why I’ve always made it a priority – from my 2008 campaign until now. And it’s why I’m proud to announce @allontheline’s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U. Join us: https://t.co/yrWJ50wSdE https://t.co/HiKvGd2XyE
With summer winding down, here’s a sampling of what Michelle and I have been listening to — some new, some old, some fast, some slow. Hope you enjoy. https://t.co/BS5ri1lvxz
A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else’s life. It can help you find common ground. And it’s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground’s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix. https://t.co/KzkYFqjrFV
Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/JG7Jgu4p9t
Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: https://t.co/reTnmcg3xo

The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. https://t.co/dqnvNk9cQR
Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline’s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today: https://t.co/d9zwitUNOa https://t.co/mEbwKCDUiP
Here’s a worthwhile Sunday read: “…nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.” https://t.co/tpdMZ9hJoE
I’ve always been proud of what this team accomplished during my administration. But more than what we did, I’m proud of how they’re continuing to fight for an America that’s better. https://t.co/0cfDltjueP
Economist Raj Chetty is not only identifying the decline in opportunity we’ve seen in recent decades—but trying to reverse it. Inequality, like many problems we face, is as vast as it is complex. But this article left me a little more hopeful: https://t.co/CcsXpVVfkP
Here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: A new study on the Medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the Affordable Care Act—and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms: https://t.co/Lj4g7lGFnq
In America, we don’t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it’s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtG
#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. There, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better. https://t.co/fKgrVRiHhc
I have a good feeling about these Chicago @UrbanAlliance interns. Thanks for letting me spend yesterday afternoon with you—you’re going to go on to do incredible things and make many people proud. In fact, you already have. https://t.co/ZjzFQmBQqm
The @ObamaFoundation is helping a new generation of leaders make their mark, and there’s an extraordinary group gathering this week for Obama Leaders: Africa. Their work will help unlock the incredible promise of the continent—and make the world better for all of us. https://t.co/rnPHn9UuEn
Proud to rep America’s best team! Congrats @USWNT and thanks for being such a strong inspiration for women and girls—and everybody—all across the country. https://t.co/9Gp6UTZhEE
Yes! Fourth star. Back to back. Congrats to the record breakers on the @USWNT, an incredible team that’s always pushing themselves—and the rest of us—to be even better. Love this team. #OneNationOneTeam
Happy Fourth of July, everybody! This is always a great day in the Obama family: a chance to celebrate America—and Malia’s birthday, too. Hope all of you are able to get some time with friends, family, and fireworks. https://t.co/Gn9kVCCnuf
I’m admittedly biased, but this article gibes with my experience about what all of us might take away from the “aloha spirit.” https://t.co/TCgvZYzuHe
Congrats to the USWNT! A great performance from a great team—looking forward to Sunday. #OneNationOneTeam
No one changes the world alone. That’s why the @ObamaFoundation is connecting emerging leaders from South Africa to Singapore to the South Side of Chicago—so they can change the world together. Read my reflection on our second year: https://t.co/ly3en2Neu4
The most important job in our democracy is citizen. If you’re tired of politicians manipulating maps and ignoring the will of voters, I hope you’ll sign @allontheline’s Citizen Commitment today: https://t.co/CUAaoAGY6z
50 years ago, history was written at the Stonewall Inn when New York's LGBT community stood up, spoke out, and started a movement. In 2016 I was proud to designate it as a national monument—a reminder the arc of our history is an arc of progress as long as we keep pushing for it. https://t.co/xyvYfuoJwK
What a gift to come across this interview with Julia “Hurricane” Hawkins. I’m as grateful for her life advice as I am impressed by her 100-meter dash time. https://t.co/8lc9Cimqyt

On Juneteenth, we celebrate our capacity to make real the promise of our founding, that thing inside each of us that says America is not yet finished, that compels all of us to fight for justice and equality until this country we love more closely aligns with our highest ideals. https://t.co/2XAKRuRrbG
Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: https://t.co/kSkLHbfnc3
This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn’t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96B7fkBM4u
Yes we can, Greta. I’m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. https://t.co/sUBwC0uNW8
Happy Father’s Day to Charles, one of our @ObamaFoundation Fellows, and all the dads at Fathers’ Uplift. Today, we’re celebrating fathers like these who provide a powerful example—not only for their kids, but for the rest of us, too. https://t.co/GJsxi8DozY
The @USWNT is something to smile about. It was great to celebrate with them back in 2015 and I'm excited to root them on in their drive to earn their fourth star. Best of luck to these champions for equality, on and off the field. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/AHcHGATy5S
Six years ago, David Ortiz's spirit and resolve helped us all begin to heal from the Boston Marathon bombing. Today, I want to join many others in wishing him a speedy recovery of his own. Get well soon, Papi. https://t.co/9orpBgnVI5
Last week, it was Virginia Beach. But day after day and year after year, too many families and communities are shattered by senseless gun violence. We can't get numb to this. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, pledge to speak out, #WearOrange — and vote — to protect lives.
You've got a lot to be proud of, Jiwandeep. Thanks for everything you do to make this country a little more equal. Turban looks great, by the way. Happy Pride Month, everybody! https://t.co/SO7mgnOkgl
What a life. American history has always been driven by visionaries like Leah Chase—and all the men and women who worked and ate at Dooky Chase’s over the years—folks who serve up progress one bowl of gumbo at a time. https://t.co/2LpuIbxvHk https://t.co/Y4i5snKjn7
A story worth sharing: Twelve years ago, Brian joined my first presidential campaign. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with ALS and launched @iamalsorg to find a cure. Brian and Sandra wake up every day believing that we can win this fight—and that makes me hopeful, too. https://t.co/eETCgFnLgP

Great to get out there and take a few cuts at the plate yesterday—I had a blast with all these extraordinary young people. Thanks for letting me drop in and thanks to the Nationals Youth Academy for the outstanding work you do to support youth in DC. https://t.co/GKRMd8kZxm
Here’s a great story: While we’ve still got a lot of work to do to make college affordable for everyone, that didn’t stop Robert F. Smith from seizing an opportunity to make a difference. He’s erasing the student loan debt for this year’s @Morehouse grads. https://t.co/I3X38Pbpjz
Happy Mother's Day to the most caring, brilliant, funny, and grounded woman I know—a perfect role model not just for our daughters, but so many others. Love you, @MichelleObama. https://t.co/liWmYaEPVk

Condolences to the family of John Singleton. His seminal work, Boyz n the Hood, remains one of the most searing, loving portrayals of the challenges facing inner-city youth. He opened doors for filmmakers of color to tell powerful stories that have been too often ignored.
Congratulations to the new class of @ObamaFoundation Fellows! Their work in every region of the globe is already making the world better, and I hope this experience helps them make an even bigger impact. https://t.co/azK2Y9Iw5c https://t.co/tuKO1SFhSK

Dominique’s story is a reminder to us that where you’re from shouldn’t define what you can achieve. I’m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. https://t.co/eD95oWrOk4
This generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world. So while this challenge is only getting more urgent, they show us the kind of action it'll take to meet this moment.
And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEI
I met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month. Luisa, the organizer behind the student movement in Germany, says, “It’s our future and we’re not going to stop fighting for it.” https://t.co/hS03PCWYAq
They're people like 16-year-old @GretaThunberg, whose protests at Swedish parliament sparked a movement. Inspired by Greta's action, Fridays for Future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate. https://t.co/un7nBhEF8i
Young people all over the world are leading the way in the fight to protect our planet because they know their future depends on it. This Earth Day, I want to celebrate the courageous, committed young leaders who are stepping up to save the one planet we've got.

The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka.
Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It’s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost – but it’s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. https://t.co/SpMEvv1BzB
Congratulations, Tiger! To come back and win the Masters after all the highs and lows is a testament to excellence, grit, and determination.
Another good story worth sharing: From one "kid from Akron" to a new generation of Akron kids, some remarkable early achievements at @IPROMISESchool. Great work, @KingJames—and even better work by those students. Proud to be a witness to their success: https://t.co/ctWfKnA5GL

Great to see Chicago’s historic mayoral race between two highly qualified candidates. Congrats to our next mayor, Lori Lightfoot—and Toni Preckwinkle campaigned hard and did us proud. I know that with our city’s heart and Lori’s leadership, Chicago’s best days are still ahead.
Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors – she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know “Finding My Voice” will inspire others to lift their voices, too. https://t.co/nWTBDByMoz
Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress—it's a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who’ve taken the torch. This group is going to be driving progress for a long time to come. https://t.co/W5dDlDtNzE

In 2011, I visited the tiny town of Moneygall and got to walk around in the house where my great-great-great grandfather Falmouth Kearney lived his early life. I'll always be grateful for the warmth and generosity of the Irish people. Happy St. Patrick's Day! -Barack O’Bama https://t.co/abDtarFbR5
Michelle and I send our condolences to the people of New Zealand. We grieve with you and the Muslim community. All of us must stand against hatred in all its forms.

Preethi, Alice, and Sefora are just three of many @ObamaFoundation leaders who remind us what International Women’s Day is all about: imagining a world free of artificial ceilings for the next generation—and doing the hard work to get us there.
And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/cRb4EKcrvv
.@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay. More importantly, she’s fighting a narrative that suggests our differences are more important than our shared humanity. https://t.co/jNIiKIAZaO
.@preethiherman is helping women unleash their power to change their societies. As head of the https://t.co/3RwHe5Razz Foundation, she’s leading an initiative that combines online tools with in-person organizing, giving women a voice in her native India—and beyond. https://t.co/TKuAKVL5Y1
On International Women’s Day, I’m reflecting on the future we all want for our daughters: one where they can live out their aspirations without limits. And I’m celebrating some of the women who are building that future for all of us today.

Happy Valentine’s Day to the extraordinarily smart, beautiful, funny, one and only @MichelleObama. It’s true; she does get down to Motown. https://t.co/uypbZsEiqB
In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them.
Don’t be sad it’s over, be proud it taught us so much. Congrats to all the men and women of @NASA on a @MarsRovers mission that beat all expectations, inspired a new generation of Americans, and demands we keep investing in science that pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.
Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.
My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: https://t.co/gjBYHHImzB
We lost two great Americans today – Frank Robinson and John Dingell – citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field.

I’ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life’s most persistent and urgent question: "What are you doing for others?" Let’s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.
I knew it way back then and I’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uC9J4
In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’ll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody!
I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9
Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ
Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd
Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO
As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I’m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year.
As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL

As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/RMJgrWQhP2
No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I’m going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. https://t.co/8mHMsXGY0g
Happy Hanukkah! Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours.
America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight – and all who were inspired by George and Barbara’s example. https://t.co/g9OUPu2pjY
I am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be. Who understand that hope requires action. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/AbjXUwCh6z
Thanks to the Chicago @FoodDepository team for all you do and to the volunteers who are doing great work and let me crash today. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! https://t.co/r4QeBeCoT1

Of course, @MichelleObama’s my wife, so I’m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise – one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE
Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who’s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who’ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk
To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend.
Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn
Today is the day. Today, it’s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. https://t.co/6xdMbKhwkr
If you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. Go vote! https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX
When you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance.
When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment – and make sure they’re paid equally.
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen.
Tomorrow’s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot.
Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP
Elections matter. You have the power to protect a family’s health care. Make a plan, grab some friends, and vote: https://t.co/rY8Ip1km9p
While we're talking about preexisting conditions, the ACA is the law that finally protected your coverage for preexisting conditions.

Those protections and your health care are absolutely at stake on Tuesday. Vote for Democrats who’ll protect them. https://t.co/BDDmY60u8k
Not sure who and what you can vote for? Head over to https://t.co/SHxg6ael0O to look up your state, learn who's running to represent you, which measures you can help decide, and more. Read up, and get ready to vote on November 6.
Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power — use it! In most states, you don't even have to wait until Election Day to cast a ballot. Find out where you can vote before Nov. 6: https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX https://t.co/hWkFHqi49K
We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.
The last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. More people go to Coachella. There’s no good excuse not to vote.

The antidote to government by a powerful few is government by the organized, energized many. This National Voter Registration Day, make sure you're registered, vote early if you can, or show up on November 6. This moment is too important to sit out.

We will always remember everyone we lost on 9/11, thank the first responders who keep us safe, and honor all who defend our country and the ideals that bind us together. There's nothing our resilience and resolve can’t overcome, and no act of terror can ever change who we are.

Bobby Kennedy was one of my heroes. He was someone who showed us the power of acting on our ideals, the idea that any of us can be one of the “million different centers of energy and daring” that ultimately combine to change the world for the better. https://t.co/nAiPiGercs
I’m confident that, together, they’ll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes.
Today I’m proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates – leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent: https://t.co/gWzalQhFas
Mandela Day is about taking action to change the world for the better. In these young people, I see Madiba's example of persistence and hope. They are poised to make this world more peaceful, more prosperous, and more just. https://t.co/GJDuOs1hkH
This week, I’m traveling to Africa for the first time since I left office – a continent of wonderful diversity, thriving culture, and remarkable stories. As I prepare for this trip, I wanted to share a list of books that I’d recommend for summer reading: https://t.co/W4Jc0N23iy
San Francisco Mayor George Moscone &amp; Supervisor Harvey Milk embodied the optimistic, progressive vision of our city. 41 years after they were murdered in a shocking act of brutality, we will never stop advancing their mission to bring about a more caring, inclusive future.
These are the facts, and they are not contested. Read the timeline of Trump’s pressure campaign to get a foreign country to interfere in our elections. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/RnUxIbCvrC

All freedom-loving people in the U.S. and around the world are inspired by yesterday’s historic vote in #HongKong! The people of Hong Kong cast their resounding vote for democratic freedoms and autonomy, which must be fully respected by Beijing.
Reports that more than 100 protestors have been killed by Iranian security forces raise serious concerns. All Iranians should be able to make their voices heard without fear of reprisal. Iran must immediately restore full internet access and allow all to speak out.
Whether calling on @SenateMajLdr McConnell to finally call a vote on life-saving legislation to #EndGunViolence or hearing from young immigration activists, we will never give up our fight #ForThePeople. Here are a few moments that stood out. https://t.co/uOrN7VthNR

The President’s call set off alarms across the White House.

“The US has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say it’s reciprocal.”

“I would like you to do us a favor though.”

“There’s been a lot of talk about Biden’s son.”

Watch the witnesses at 9:00:

Today, @HouseDemocrats marched to @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office to demand action to #EndGunViolence.

For Americans with diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life &amp; death.

When Members of Congress take the oath of office, we become custodians of the Constitution. We must uphold our duty to #DefendOurDemocracy.
We legislate. We investigate. We litigate. And yesterday, we had an important victory in our lawsuit to confirm Congress’s right to perform oversight, as the Court of Appeals ruled that the President’s financial records should be turned over to the Congress.
President Trump’s efforts to cover up his betrayal of his oath of office almost make the things Nixon did look small.
We are closely following updates regarding the school shooting in Santa Clarita. Thankful for courageous first responders working to save lives &amp; protect the community. What will it take for Republicans to stop blocking efforts to #EndGunViolence?

If I was concerned about things being easy, I never would have come to Congress in the first place.

#DefendOurDemocracy #LSSC https://t.co/cSMn7Y8OLT
Our investigation into the President’s betrayal of his oath of office is based on a simple question: is it acceptable for a president to pressure a foreign government to undermine our elections for his political gain? #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/2c9RAT0t8f
The American people don’t need a grim reaper.
 
They need leaders who will #EndGunViolence, #SaveTheNet, and reinstate the protections found in #VAWA.
 
It’s time for Senate Republicans to get to work.

I’m sure a little encouragement from the President wouldn’t hurt.
The House has already passed these and many more, with passage of H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, coming soon as well. And yet Mitch McConnell wants to brag to his donors that he is the “Grim Reaper” instead of passing them.
H.R. 582 would #RaiseTheWage for workers across the country – reinvigorating the middle class &amp; strengthening our economy.
 
By passing the #ClimateActionNow Act, we will confront the Climate Crisis, something young people around the world are rightly demanding.
Some key examples?
 
H.R. 7, the #PaycheckFairness Act, would ensure equal pay for women nationwide.
 
Meanwhile, the #ForThePeople Act would enact the most ambitious set of democracy reforms and ethics standards in a generation.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The scores of bills we’ve passed aren’t busy work.
 
If passed into law, they will improve the lives of Americans across the country &amp; build a better future for generations to come.
 
But the @SenateGOP has made the cynical decision to ignore it all.
.@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Washington want you to think Democrats can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.
 
But we’ve been fighting #ForThePeople since Day One.
 
The House-passed legislation piling up outside @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office proves it. https://t.co/vgb0QajcaW

Dems will keep fighting the GOP's anti-science agenda &amp; urging Senate to pass #ClimateActionNow.
We’ve learned so much about Trump’s months-long campaign to pressure Ukraine because military veterans &amp; his own national security aides stood up to tell the truth. They put their country ahead of everything else. It’s not too late for Republicans in Congress to do the same.
Too often, the tragic reality of the Armenian Genocide has been denied. Today, an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the House ensured that the truth will forever be etched into the Congressional Record. https://t.co/9NE5XZyK3o
The House will vote on Thursday to move forward on open hearings as we set out the process for the next phase of our inquiry. Americans will get to hear about the President’s abuse of power firsthand. I gather Republican Leaders do not actually want that after all. #TruthExposed https://t.co/tUeHeT6Ezj
Christine Darden, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan shattered barriers of race &amp; gender with their work on space exploration. It was a pleasure to sign legislation to formally recognize their inspiring contributions with a Congressional Gold Medal. https://t.co/tJ269lAidV
Singling out and banning @joshuawongcf from running in the upcoming District Council election is another blow against rule of law in Hong Kong and the principle of “One Country, Two Systems.”

The people of #HongKong should be able to choose their elected officials.
Today, @VetAffairsDems made progress for 2 million women veterans by advancing the bipartisan, bicameral Deborah Sampson Act to address the inequities at VA. Today’s poison pill amendments and GOP walkout are a shame. https://t.co/SJMvINNDgU
Everybody has read your words on the call. The Ukrainian President asks for military aid to fend off the Russian attack, you say “I want you to do us a favor though,” and then you spend the rest of the call asking for bogus investigations to smear your political opponents. https://t.co/vI2eD4T6vK
Grateful that Brandon Lee has returned home to SF for refuge and care after being brutally shot in the Philippines, where he was fighting for environmental and indigenous peoples’ rights. I have encouraged the Philippine government to investigate this disturbing crime.
Senator Kay Hagan was a woman of extraordinary courage, whose leadership was marked by strength, grace and passion. Her work to protect every American’s right to health care and defend women’s rights and freedoms leave a lasting legacy in North Carolina and across America.
Chairman John Conyers’ life was lived in service to achieving true equality in America. My prayers are with his wife, Monica, their sons John and Carl, and the entire Conyers family at this time. https://t.co/WWqVZNG6Da
The House has been following the facts and the evidence has only made the President’s own words on his call more appalling. This resolution will set up the structure for the next phase where the American people can hear those facts for themselves in open hearings. #TruthExposed https://t.co/PSOBzm71BQ
It’s been more than a month and Republicans in Washington still won’t answer the simple question: is it appropriate for a president to pressure a foreign country to undermine our elections?

Every national security expert knows the answer. #TruthExposed https://t.co/TOC3fOTJ3F
Look to your oath.

“Republican senators are lost and adrift as the impeachment inquiry enters its second month, navigating the grave threat to President Trump largely in the dark, frustrated by the absence of a credible case to defend his conduct...”

https://t.co/ayGDWQqyd7
Grateful for the heroism of firefighters and first responders working to protect all in the path of fires across California. We stand with our friends &amp; neighbors who have been impacted. https://t.co/pBVjJUm80p
As we remember those we lost in Pittsburgh one year ago, we must rededicate ourselves to ending the scourges of anti-Semitism, white supremacism, racism and xenophobia wherever and whenever they are found. https://t.co/XyqTKbUHIw https://t.co/3eOZuVRsmb
The death of al-Baghdadi is significant, but it does not mean the death of ISIS. @realDonaldTrump must present the American people with a clear strategy to confront ISIS.
Americans salute the heroism, dedication &amp; skill of our military and our intelligence professionals following news that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. military raid. https://t.co/ohh7t3qGBP
Today’s ruling in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia strikes another blow to President Trump’s attempt to put himself above the law and challenges the Trump Admin’s unprecedented, blanket defiance of Congress’s oversight. https://t.co/2gq12isPpz

By engaging in legislative trickery, Senate Republicans are pretending to help Venezuelans in the US. The House has already passed bipartisan legislation that grants TPS for Venezuela immediately. Senate Republicans must stop pretending and act now! https://t.co/jeFKVQe1p8
Chairman Elijah Cummings was a true master of the House, using his expertise to ensure all Americans had access to opportunity. It is only fitting that he lie in state in the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/WI694JuEOy
Chairman Elijah Cummings believed in the promise of America because he had lived it. He committed his life to ensuring other Americans had many of the same opportunities. Today, we honor his legacy of service. https://t.co/iPorBFKVBx

Watch here at 11 am ET: https://t.co/rFd2fqW3Qv
America’s elections &amp; democracy are under relentless, ongoing foreign attack, yet every @HouseGOP member voted against strengthening our defenses. Yet again, they ignore that their oath is to protect our national security, not the President. #SHIELDAct https://t.co/h6Iqym4dWH
The Debbie Smith Act’s passage is only one step to combat domestic violence and sexual assault in our country. The Senate GOP must pass our bipartisan VAWA bill so that victims &amp; survivors have real, effective solutions to recover, heal and seek justice. https://t.co/7vvWEjXQte
So pleased to welcome Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang to the U.S. Capitol. My full support and admiration goes to those who have taken to the streets week after week in non-violent protest to fight for democracy and the rule of law in #HongKong. https://t.co/maeTwTR8eV
Each time we visit our troops in Afghanistan, I am struck by the courage &amp; dedication with which they carry out the U.S.-NATO mission. Grateful to them &amp; their Afghan partners for their service and for providing operational updates to our bipartisan delegation. https://t.co/dQaOLzoSkl

This week, President Trump has:

Called the Constitutional ban on profiting off the presidency “phony”

Given blanket defiance of lawful subpoenas

Stood by his shakedown of a foreign power as “perfect”

He insists he is above the law. We are following the facts. #TruthExposed
What the @HouseGOP fears the most is the truth. Instead of discussing the facts, they choose to attack @RepAdamSchiff.

To be clear: Rep. Schiff is a great patriot. America is well-served by his strategic leadership. https://t.co/iS1SoIVCPs
We are sad about losing two of Baltimore’s great leaders, Elijah Cummings and Tommy D’Alesandro. Here we are on a happier day. https://t.co/mT55a1uI2T

Republicans face a simple question: is the president allowed to pressure a foreign country into interfering in our elections?

History will remember their answer, or their silence. #TruthExposed https://t.co/ps02g1AlYL
The President's Chief of Staff says there’s “no cover-up.”

But President Trump’s:

State Department
Department of Defense
OMB
Energy Department
&amp; Vice President

Are all defying lawful subpoenas &amp; document requests.

If they have nothing to hide, why not comply? #TruthExposed
God blessed America with the life &amp; leadership of Elijah Cummings. May we all be inspired by his example to go forth in a way that is worthy of our oaths of office, worthy of the vision of our Founders &amp; worthy of the aspirations of our children. https://t.co/aiVkZb8ZxF

Read my full statement with @SenSchumer here: https://t.co/MPt8xAolQ6
Yesterday, the House sent an overwhelming bipartisan message demanding a clear strategy to defeat ISIS, and the Senate should do the same immediately.
This sham ceasefire does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS from prisoners from escaping, and shows the President’s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS.
.@realDonaldTrump is flailing. Reversing sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America’s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike.
For 47 years, the #CleanWaterAct has safeguarded our children’s clean water. But since Day One, the Trump Admin has given big special interests free rein to poison our communities &amp; threaten families' health. @HouseDemocrats are ending this corruption &amp; fighting #ForThePeople.
When Chairman Elijah Cummings spoke, America listened. He pushed each and every one of his colleagues to work for a higher purpose. May we all seek to follow his example. https://t.co/pYgeNqpvko

We can save billions by finally negotiating for #LowerDrugCosts. And that’s just the beginning: H.R. 3 would extend those lower prices to Americans across the country. https://t.co/evDporagP8
As we find ourselves in a situation where the President gave a green light to the Turks to bomb and effectively unleashed ISIS, we must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting.
Next, we must put together the strongest bipartisan, bicameral sanctions package similar to the bipartisan bill the House is advancing.
Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President’s dangerous decision in Syria immediately.
The departure of the Acting Homeland Security Secretary is the latest sign of this Administration’s failed leadership, which has worsened the humanitarian situation at the border, and injected pain and tragedy into countless lives. https://t.co/XvIERZL1qF

If you want to be part of a movement to transform America, which doesn’t have a super PAC, whose average contribution is just $18, chip in to our campaign tonight. #DemDebate https://t.co/muMLwNWJ0W

We will prosecute the fossil fuel executives who knowingly destroyed the planet. #DemDebate https://t.co/usTGGYqlpp
When you talk about the pain of working people, we are not so divided. The majority of Americans agree:

We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage.
We must take on the fossil fuel industry to save the planet.
We must take on the NRA to end gun violence. #DemDebate
It's simple: If the president broke the law, he should be prosecuted. #DemDebate
President Obama: Medicare for All is a "good idea."

I agree. #DemDebate https://t.co/hEykXZjLxd

Here are the questions we should be asking about Medicare for All:

➡️Why are we the only major country not to make health care a right?
➡️Why should pharma companies be able to charge whatever they want?
➡️How much money do insurance companies spend to buy politicians? https://t.co/WDJIYfCMhM

When I ran for Congress we won a seat that had been Republican for decades.

I passed more amendments than any member from 1995 to 2007.

Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate

@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.

Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.

We know in our bones this election is different. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.

We must make Trump a one-term president. https://t.co/EuEVkE424E
The energy at the @NVDems’ First in the West event was incredible. Folks are fired up to take back our country and make Donald Trump a one-term president.
 
If you’re fired up too, join our campaign today and let’s get to work: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW https://t.co/6KeGRJxUop

Sunday night in a backyard. Monday morning at a store. We must do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic because we cannot go on like this any longer.

I’m inspired by the strength and resilience of Chrissy and survivors across the country, and proud of the change the Violence Against Women Act created, but we still have further to go.

China’s internment of nearly one million Uighur Muslims is among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today. The U.S. cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world. https://t.co/PQp04TWjyd
I’ve spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power. That’s what motivated me to write &amp; champion the Violence Against Women Act. The law helped change our culture—but there’s more work to do.

At the CNN Town Hall, I was asked what changes in American society I’m proudest of. Here’s what I had to say: https://t.co/X5OF6rwlJy
I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.

America is more equal because of Chief Justice Mark Cady. His landmark decision brought marriage equality to Iowa and pushed our nation closer to our highest ideals. @DrBiden and I send our condolences to his loved ones. His integrity and commitment to justice will be missed. https://t.co/MVyY03Txak

This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism. https://t.co/qmyRbxGdiq
We will beat the @NRA.

If you like your private health insurance plan, you shouldn’t be forced to give it up. If you don't like it, you should be able to buy into a Medicare-like public option.

That's the choice I will give Americans as president. https://t.co/sHkmn3mDxP
Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.

Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer.
President Trump campaigned on repairing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But after countless “Infrastructure Weeks,” he has failed to deliver results. It has to change.

Today, I'm calling for a transformational investment in our nation's future: https://t.co/mHG958ffo8
The Affordable Care Act
An assault weapons ban
The Violence Against Women Act

There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do. I know what it takes to get the job done.
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the atrocities President Trump continues to carry out at the border. This is not who we are. https://t.co/KhV9ds0hNy

You shouldn't be forced to give up the health insurance and benefits that you fought for. Under my plan, you will be able to keep them. https://t.co/lJZ9fvPWeV
This decision puts the health of the American people at risk — it’s unacceptable. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and choose science over fiction once again. https://t.co/YqVaGecPgQ
First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy.
We have to lead the world by our example and make clear that human rights, civil rights, and civil liberties matter to us. https://t.co/Ma26IxrInO

Change starts at the local level — I learned that firsthand as a 28-year-old on the New Castle County Council. On #NationalRunforOfficeDay, I'm asking you to join me and run for something. There is too much at stake in 2020 to sit on the sidelines. https://t.co/cEgKOoVhVI
President Trump's erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our national security and set our world on edge. Every day that he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States. https://t.co/QcUR5hVCdJ
Every worker should have the chance to join a union which bargains to ensure they get paid a living wage and have protections against sexual harassment. That's why I'm proud to stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking in Detroit and across the country today. https://t.co/r0y6uDM2na
Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist threats. It is intolerable that Israeli civilians live their lives under the constant fear of rocket attacks. That's why our administration was such a strong supporter of Israel's life-saving Iron Dome. https://t.co/aQOUdKZqq7

President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families. 

As president, I will meet our sacred obligation. https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.

Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them. https://t.co/jtOPJDnE30

Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.

This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.

Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform.

Let’s be clear: Our government criminalizes too many things and sends too many people to jail. In a Warren administration, we will: 

☑️ Repeal the 1994 Crime Bill 
☑️ Legalize marijuana
☑️ Undo the legacy of the War on Drugs
☑️ End cash bail and private prisons
History has proven that when working women fight together, they win. The Black women of the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike show the true story of American persistence. https://t.co/9ht7ophMNx
There have been 2,302 mass shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook. We shouldn't have to live like this. But unless we root out corruption in Washington, the gun lobby will always have a veto on any legislation to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/QPx0DtRGIA
I support the students, organizers, and activists demanding accountability on climate action and more at #HarvardYale. Climate change is an existential threat, and we must take bold action to fight this crisis. https://t.co/lm1V6honI4
My heart is with @LucyMcBath today. Jordan Davis should be alive. We must call out the fact that Black Americans have borne the brunt of the gun violence tragedy in our country. I promise to fight my heart out—for justice for Jordan, and to end this epidemic. https://t.co/XbUxZTwpz9
I’m glad everyone is enjoying the Bailey photos we sent out yesterday!

This guy was Mick Mulvaney’s right-hand man in Congress. Now, he has a plum job as a payday loan lobbyist and is cozying up to Mulvaney to advance his clients’ interests.

In a Warren administration, we’ll stand up to lobbyists and the predatory loan industry. https://t.co/ShreGlDn4L
@maddygunawan It was great meeting you, Maddy. Thanks for being in this fight!
Mike Bloomberg is placing $34 million in TV ads in one week—the most of any presidential candidate in history.

That’s one way to pay less under my #WealthTax. Because in a Warren administration, he and his billionaire friends would finally have to pay their fair share. https://t.co/qWHtk37zaM
I’m grateful to have you in this fight, @bjoewolf. Together, we’ll keep fighting to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/eCDVw2Pcys
Unlike other candidates, I don’t host fancy fundraisers, I don’t take money from PACs, and I don’t cozy up to billionaires.

Instead, small-dollar donors are the backbone of our grassroots campaign. Donate whatever you can now, and join the fight! https://t.co/EBLSASRJNB
Donald Trump is a walking, talking conflict of interest. It should be illegal for a president to twist the rules of our government to make themselves richer. Under my anti-corruption bill—the biggest since Watergate—it would be. https://t.co/icKIZvutSv
.@JayInslee is exactly right. The Keystone XL pipeline is a harmful project that locks us into further dependence on some of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet. We need clean energy and protection for tribal lands, not another crummy fossil fuel investment. https://t.co/AfbBYaZJCo
People who made it big should chip in to make sure that everyone else can make it, too. https://t.co/5rifrKrsLz
When workers fight, workers win. Congratulations to @WUWFP employees on unionizing! Let’s keep fighting together to ensure that it’s quick and easy for everyone to join unions. https://t.co/nByv7mZ8oi
Iranians have taken to the streets to protest corruption and authoritarianism. This struggle must ultimately be fought and won by the people of Iran, but we support their demand for dignity, freedom to connect to the outside world, and right to peacefully demonstrate.
.@IndivisibleTeam carries out important work organizing activism across the country and making sure our voices are heard. I’m grateful for our thoughtful conversation yesterday about how we can keep moving our country forward. https://t.co/Wl9Mx8Tg7d
I’m inspired by the people of Nashville who are building a grassroots movement to ban private prisons from their community. In a Warren administration, we’ll ban them at the federal level. https://t.co/YbhoGdegAx

Black history is American history.

The lessons of Black history—from the Atlanta washerwoman's strike, to Dorothy Bolden’s fight for domestic workers—will not be lost.

What an honor to be with @BlackWomxnFor and @AyannaPressley at @CAU last night. https://t.co/J1TEOfY1Qa
This isn’t about drivers’ licenses or the Census. This is another cruel way that the Trump administration and Republicans are working to undercount, underfund, and take political power away from immigrant communities. We must fight back.
https://t.co/3VaJlTUMDy
It's my honor to have @Deb4CongressNM, @KatiePorterOC, and @AyannaPressley as my Campaign Co-Chairs. Big structural change can't wait, and we'll fight for it—together. https://t.co/ZnI2xat8xN
This cruel, unnecessary policy will put asylum seekers at risk. Our laws and our values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. I'll reverse this policy and welcome asylum seekers. https://t.co/1ul4h79BL1
WeWork is laying off 2,400 employees—while its founder walks away with a massive $1.7 billion golden parachute.

Let’s be clear: It’s time for our government to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. We must be honest about our history, and do what’s right so that our nation can begin to heal. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Lsl47JezpM
White supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair. Now more than ever, all of us must embrace the lessons of Black history to confront this challenge. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/iPVwOk33HI
Racism props up the rich and powerful, leaving them free to take more power for themselves. And the rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. If we want power, we have to fight for it. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/owktsOca4G
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Yes, there’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.
@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.
@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.
@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.
@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!
@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.
@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.
@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.
@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.
@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.
@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.
@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.
@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?
@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.
@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf
@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.
@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.
@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.
@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.
@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!
@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”
@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.
@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.
@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.
@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.
@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.
@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.
@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.
@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU
@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.
I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we've fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarren
We're live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Tc7WIWuUuk
Donald Trump's racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan.
See you soon! https://t.co/YEAPDgA6OI
Climate change is an existential threat—and unless we take urgent action to end this crisis, future generations will face catastrophic consequences. That's why I'm fighting for the #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/zZo5yT1dbP
Big Tech companies are not doing enough to protect our privacy—and they won't until they face real competition and accountability. https://t.co/RQYSpZzkcK
Reproductive rights are economic rights. Reproductive rights are human rights. And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.
@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!
Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he'll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I'll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3S
The way I see it, this is about our values. 

No American should ever die because they couldn't afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. 

We need a health care system that reflects our values. That's #MedicareForAll.
Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump's inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I've pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34K
Awood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAru
I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president. It's time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won't be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I've got a plan for that.
This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.
Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook's board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylC
We're not leaving yet, Atlanta! Join us at @CAU on Thursday, where I'll be sharing the stories of some of the most persistent and fearless fighters, Black women who proved that when working women fight together, they win. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/XDcLiZccSL
To everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!

I’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together. https://t.co/6Wir1mdB46
The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don't make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7A
I believe that abortion rights are human rights.

I believe that they're also economic rights.

And protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. #DemDebate https://t.co/kDrlXSKr4Z
I’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebate
I just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlT
We have a lot of good ideas, yet we don't make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebate
In my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3e
I’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It's time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9y
Abortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It's just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebate
When I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebate
Right now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebate
We need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here's what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:
✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k
✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools
✅ $50 billion in HBCUs
✅ Cancel student loan debt
#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqR
Our defense budget is massively bloated—we need to end the cozy relationship between defense contractors and the Pentagon, then pull out a sharp knife and make real cuts. I've got a plan for that. #DemDebate https://t.co/n4M5U2JJjN

For decades, racist redlining practices blocked Black and Brown families from home ownership and building wealth. My housing plan helps level the playing field for families who were denied wealth-building opportunities. #DemDebate https://t.co/vb84trHx3O
Child care is personal for me. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child. It’ll be free for millions of families, and affordable for all. Use my calculator to see how much your family would save: https://t.co/urL0bLuxrg
Billionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04h
Tens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.
I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.

My #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebate
Let me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:

✔️ Universal Child Care
✔️ Universal pre-k
✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools
✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs
✔️ Cancel student loan debt 

#DemDebate
My #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebate
The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebate
The Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That's what's happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebate
Today’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebate
Politicians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize. I stand with @StaceyAbrams—and that's why I have a plan to guarantee the right to vote and end voter suppression. https://t.co/wRvU1FR0yJ

37 million Americans didn’t fill a prescription because of costs. 
36 million skipped a recommended test or treatment because of costs. 
40 million didn’t go to a doctor to check out a health problem because of costs.

On Transgender Day of Remembrance, we #SayTheirNames, and we re-commit to ending this epidemic. #TDoR https://t.co/6mTLM2grTq
I’m fighting my heart out for Rachael, for Carl, for baby Willow—and for you, @AdyBarkan.

(P.S. Willow: Your dad is an inspiration. I’m so honored to know him, and to fight alongside him for a better future for all.) https://t.co/PUqORwiJda
We wouldn't be this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without activists like @AdyBarkan, who has given his life to ensure that every American gets the medical care they need. I’m grateful down to my toes to be in this fight alongside you, Ady. https://t.co/jAo8dTcaAM
I’m deeply grateful to have your support in this fight, @AdyBarkan. I make this promise to you, to Willow, and to every family in America: I will fight for your family as hard as I fight for my own.

White nationalist violence is a domestic terrorism threat—and we must treat it like one. I've got a plan to fight white nationalist violence.

White nationalism has no place in our country, our White House, or our Congress. Let's start by getting Steve King out of office and electing @JDScholten to replace him. #IA04
I'm proud to fight alongside @AyannaPressley for the big, structural change we need—and so happy to announce that she'll be one of my special guests for my speech in Atlanta on Thursday! https://t.co/xbMgOhMCoS
From the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory to the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike, history has proven that when working women fight together, they win. Hear @rgay share that story—and then join me in Atlanta on Thursday, where I'll be sharing how we can put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/AsdbVDKbsc
Our alliances are not charity or protection rackets. They enhance our security and promote our values. Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyv
I introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called "right-to-work" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their "right-to-work" law now. They shouldn't hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2W
We need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7f
Ultimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.
Finally, I'll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgv
I will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bH
My plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I'll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.
First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw
#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I've laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmf
Stephen Miller's white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. 

We need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I'll start by reversing Trump and Miller's racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6
Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.
Finally, I'll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.
I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don't violate individual rights.
Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.
Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I'll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.
Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.
We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It's clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.
But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He's made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.
Mother Emanuel AME Church.
Charlottesville.
Tree of Life Synagogue.
El Paso.
Unfortunately, these aren't isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.
The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here's my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePg
Millions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent. I’ve got a plan to make housing more affordable, protect renters from unjust eviction and discrimination, and invest in healthy and green homes. 

Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to live. https://t.co/rWDJr8EXIF
The way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win! https://t.co/NyOX0QhIhs

The forceful removal of @NJWFA State Director @SueAltman from a public hearing is outrageous. I stand with her and @WorkingFamilies. https://t.co/DEaJiC6iQA
Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: "Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity." https://t.co/AZC9kpqoqx
Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv
Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization. https://t.co/CLBQLPfTsu
Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. Can’t wait to join them in Malaysia next month. https://t.co/jrure7D6Uv

Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt.
This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country https://t.co/rBAMNk0zvb
No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/aHHeNvAisn
Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm
Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.
Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. A true team with a spirit that’d do us all well.
Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm
.@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J
Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC.
Here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu
As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why. It’s a tribute to American leadership—and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you’ll read it. https://t.co/7iUWt76xUw

One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C

Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs
Yesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaIt

Happy 85th birthday to @RealBillRussell - the greatest champion in American sports, and a lifelong warrior for justice.
My statement on the passing of former Congressman John Dingell: https://t.co/gjBYHHImzB
We lost two great Americans today – Frank Robinson and John Dingell – citizens who inspired me and so many others by leading on the civil rights issues of our time, opening doors to others, and leaving it all on the field.
As we celebrate Black History Month and Jackie Robinson’s 100th birthday, we celebrate the life of all whose courage opened the gates for everybody, and in the process, made America better. https://t.co/Fl9aDxqcGi
The @ObamaFoundation is connecting people from around the world so they can form partnerships just like this. I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what’s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. https://t.co/hFAMzW7tBq
I’ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life’s most persistent and urgent question: "What are you doing for others?" Let’s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.
I knew it way back then and I’m absolutely convinced of it today — you’re one of a kind, @MichelleObama. Happy Birthday! https://t.co/ejqm0uC9J4
In 2018 people stepped up and showed up like never before. Keep it up in 2019. We’ve got a lot of work to do, and I’ll be right there with you. Happy New Year, everybody!
I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn’t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it.
Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9
Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica. https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ
Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd
Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO
As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I’m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year.
As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL
Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/LKLqlYfFUw
There’s no better time than the holidays to give back to your community. Yesterday I got to do just that at @ChildrensHealth. As we celebrate the season and look forward to 2019, let’s recommit to doing our part to build a world that is a little more generous, tolerant, and kind. https://t.co/77rcNoY8jn
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to the extraordinary kids, families, and staff at Children’s National. And thanks for humoring me as your stand-in Santa. https://t.co/mFmYCVk7cr
Today is the last day of open enrollment. That means it’s the deadline to make sure you and the people you love have health insurance in 2019. So head over to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod to get covered! Here’s what else you need to know today about health care: https://t.co/gosn6c6uCa
Joe is right. Head to https://t.co/SS87NTsgJt before tomorrow’s deadline. And nice bracelet, by the way. https://t.co/NFy3LxZe3f
As Bobby Kennedy taught us, the thing about hope is that it travels through space *and* time, first splashing against the rocks, but eventually breaking down the walls of cruelty and injustice. And if we do our best with the time we’re given, others will take hope in our example. https://t.co/RMJgrWQhP2
No jump shots. No ferns. No memes. Not this time. I’m going to give it to you straight: If you need health insurance for 2019, the deadline to get covered is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod today and pass this on — you just might save a life. https://t.co/8mHMsXGY0g
Happy Hanukkah! Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours.
America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight – and all who were inspired by George and Barbara’s example. https://t.co/g9OUPu2pjY
I am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be. Who understand that hope requires action. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/AbjXUwCh6z
Thanks to the Chicago @FoodDepository team for all you do and to the volunteers who are doing great work and let me crash today. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! https://t.co/r4QeBeCoT1

Our future depends on all our young people, including our boys and young men of color, being able to achieve their dreams. Today, I’m proud to share @MBK_Alliance’s first investments in communities devoted to this mission. Get inspired: https://t.co/dKLWPvrFPC
Of course, @MichelleObama’s my wife, so I’m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise – one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE
Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who’s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who’ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk
To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend.
Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won’t come from one election alone – but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn
Today is the day. Today, it’s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better. So make it count. Get out there and vote. Go to https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX or call 833-336-VOTE to confirm where you can vote and check voting hours. https://t.co/6xdMbKhwkr
If you take that power and vote, something powerful happens. Change happens. Hope happens. And with each new step we take in the direction of fairness, and justice, and equality, and opportunity, hope spreads. Go vote! https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX
When you vote, you have the power to make it easier for a student to afford college, and harder for a disturbed person to shoot up a classroom. When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance.
When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment – and make sure they’re paid equally.
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen.
Tomorrow’s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot.
Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP
Elections matter. You have the power to protect a family’s health care. Make a plan, grab some friends, and vote: https://t.co/rY8Ip1km9p
While we're talking about preexisting conditions, the ACA is the law that finally protected your coverage for preexisting conditions.

Those protections and your health care are absolutely at stake on Tuesday. Vote for Democrats who’ll protect them. https://t.co/BDDmY60u8k
Not sure who and what you can vote for? Head over to https://t.co/SHxg6ael0O to look up your state, learn who's running to represent you, which measures you can help decide, and more. Read up, and get ready to vote on November 6.
Your vote can decide the health care of millions. Your voice can determine the character of our country. You have power — use it! In most states, you don't even have to wait until Election Day to cast a ballot. Find out where you can vote before Nov. 6: https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX https://t.co/hWkFHqi49K
We grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh. All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun.
The last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. More people go to Coachella. There’s no good excuse not to vote. Head over to https://t.co/zTCemnRMYV to check your registration, get your absentee ballot, and find out where to vote on November 6. https://t.co/LIQbltVJtz
America is always at our best when we look out for each other. Please do what you can to help people recover and rebuild from Hurricane Michael. https://t.co/psmPZnmlqY

Congratulations to Drew Brees on the all time passing record. Always a class act.
Happy Anniversary, @MichelleObama. For 26 years, you’ve been an extraordinary partner, someone who can always make me laugh, and my favorite person to see the world with. https://t.co/s8xoZ9j2YR
Today, I’m proud to endorse even more Democratic candidates who aren’t just running against something, but for something—to expand opportunity for all of us and to restore dignity, honor, and compassion to public service. They deserve your vote: https://t.co/NO5jnhX3XD
From civil servants to organizers, the young people I met in Amsterdam today are doing the hard work of change. And they keep at it for their communities, their countries, and the collective future of Europe and the world. Keep up the good work. https://t.co/AVtuBPHdr2
The antidote to government by a powerful few is government by the organized, energized many. This National Voter Registration Day, make sure you're registered, vote early if you can, or show up on November 6. This moment is too important to sit out.
The first class of Obama Fellows is full of leaders like Keith—hardworking, innovative, and dedicated to partnering with their communities to drive transformational change. https://t.co/FN794E7Cqs
We will always remember everyone we lost on 9/11, thank the first responders who keep us safe, and honor all who defend our country and the ideals that bind us together. There's nothing our resilience and resolve can’t overcome, and no act of terror can ever change who we are.
Today I’m at the University of Illinois to deliver a simple message to young people all over the country: You need to vote, because our democracy depends on it. I hope you'll tune in at 11am CT: https://t.co/34WjNaVAcU

Aretha helped define the American experience. In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade—our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect. May the Queen of Soul rest in eternal peace. https://t.co/bfASqKlLc5
Bobby Kennedy was one of my heroes. He was someone who showed us the power of acting on our ideals, the idea that any of us can be one of the “million different centers of energy and daring” that ultimately combine to change the world for the better. https://t.co/nAiPiGercs
I’m confident that, together, they’ll strengthen this country we love by restoring opportunity, repairing our alliances and standing in the world, and upholding our fundamental commitment to justice, fairness, responsibility, and the rule of law. But first, they need our votes.
Today I’m proud to endorse such a wide and impressive array of Democratic candidates – leaders as diverse, patriotic, and big-hearted as the America they’re running to represent: https://t.co/gWzalQhFas

San Francisco Mayor George Moscone &amp; Supervisor Harvey Milk embodied the optimistic, progressive vision of our city. 41 years after they were murdered in a shocking act of brutality, we will never stop advancing their mission to bring about a more caring, inclusive future.
These are the facts, and they are not contested. Read the timeline of Trump’s pressure campaign to get a foreign country to interfere in our elections. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/RnUxIbCvrC

All freedom-loving people in the U.S. and around the world are inspired by yesterday’s historic vote in #HongKong! The people of Hong Kong cast their resounding vote for democratic freedoms and autonomy, which must be fully respected by Beijing.
Reports that more than 100 protestors have been killed by Iranian security forces raise serious concerns. All Iranians should be able to make their voices heard without fear of reprisal. Iran must immediately restore full internet access and allow all to speak out.
Whether calling on @SenateMajLdr McConnell to finally call a vote on life-saving legislation to #EndGunViolence or hearing from young immigration activists, we will never give up our fight #ForThePeople. Here are a few moments that stood out. https://t.co/uOrN7VthNR

The President’s call set off alarms across the White House.

“The US has been very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say it’s reciprocal.”

“I would like you to do us a favor though.”

“There’s been a lot of talk about Biden’s son.”

Watch the witnesses at 9:00:

For Americans with diabetes, access to insulin is a matter of life &amp; death.

When Members of Congress take the oath of office, we become custodians of the Constitution. We must uphold our duty to #DefendOurDemocracy.
We legislate. We investigate. We litigate. And yesterday, we had an important victory in our lawsuit to confirm Congress’s right to perform oversight, as the Court of Appeals ruled that the President’s financial records should be turned over to the Congress.
President Trump’s efforts to cover up his betrayal of his oath of office almost make the things Nixon did look small.
We are closely following updates regarding the school shooting in Santa Clarita. Thankful for courageous first responders working to save lives &amp; protect the community. What will it take for Republicans to stop blocking efforts to #EndGunViolence?

Public servants across the political spectrum understand that it's not about politics to #DefendOurDemocracy. President Trump's pressure campaign was "out of bounds," and every time he insists that it was "perfect" he is saying that he is above the law. https://t.co/5MQMrfZ5fl

The President pressured a foreign country to smear his political opponents. Please read his words:

#DefendOurDemocracy #LSSC https://t.co/cSMn7Y8OLT

The American people don’t need a grim reaper.
 
They need leaders who will #EndGunViolence, #SaveTheNet, and reinstate the protections found in #VAWA.
 
It’s time for Senate Republicans to get to work.

I’m sure a little encouragement from the President wouldn’t hurt.
The House has already passed these and many more, with passage of H.R. 3, the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act, coming soon as well. And yet Mitch McConnell wants to brag to his donors that he is the “Grim Reaper” instead of passing them.
H.R. 582 would #RaiseTheWage for workers across the country – reinvigorating the middle class &amp; strengthening our economy.
 
By passing the #ClimateActionNow Act, we will confront the Climate Crisis, something young people around the world are rightly demanding.
Some key examples?
 
H.R. 7, the #PaycheckFairness Act, would ensure equal pay for women nationwide.
 
Meanwhile, the #ForThePeople Act would enact the most ambitious set of democracy reforms and ethics standards in a generation.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The scores of bills we’ve passed aren’t busy work.
 
If passed into law, they will improve the lives of Americans across the country &amp; build a better future for generations to come.
 
But the @SenateGOP has made the cynical decision to ignore it all.
.@realDonaldTrump and Republicans in Washington want you to think Democrats can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.
 
But we’ve been fighting #ForThePeople since Day One.
 
The House-passed legislation piling up outside @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s office proves it. https://t.co/vgb0QajcaW

The enduring bravery of firefighters, first responders, state leaders &amp; National Guard responding to fires across California reminds us of the urgent threat of the climate crisis.

Dems will keep fighting the GOP's anti-science agenda &amp; urging Senate to pass #ClimateActionNow.
We’ve learned so much about Trump’s months-long campaign to pressure Ukraine because military veterans &amp; his own national security aides stood up to tell the truth. They put their country ahead of everything else. It’s not too late for Republicans in Congress to do the same.
Too often, the tragic reality of the Armenian Genocide has been denied. Today, an overwhelming bipartisan vote of the House ensured that the truth will forever be etched into the Congressional Record. https://t.co/9NE5XZyK3o

This sham ceasefire does nothing to stop thousands of ISIS from prisoners from escaping, and shows the President’s complete lack of strategy to defeat ISIS.
.@realDonaldTrump is flailing. Reversing sanctions against Turkey for brutally attacking our Kurdish partners in exchange for a sham ceasefire seriously undermines the credibility of America’s foreign policy and sends a dangerous message to our allies and adversaries alike.
For 47 years, the #CleanWaterAct has safeguarded our children’s clean water. But since Day One, the Trump Admin has given big special interests free rein to poison our communities &amp; threaten families' health. @HouseDemocrats are ending this corruption &amp; fighting #ForThePeople.

It’s not who we are. We are better than this. #DemDebate https://t.co/Gyo93iKomX
Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
Joe Biden’s health care plan will offer a new choice for Americans: keep your private insurance or choose a public option like Medicare. #DemDebate https://t.co/Zy3E30WjYx
In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage.
Let’s lay out the facts: More Americans prefer a public option over Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/j7K3fRNu92
Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate
We are fired up and ready for Joe to take the stage at tonight’s #DemDebate! https://t.co/V0iGMuq3yu
Hey folks, it’s @TeamJoe here! We’ll be taking over Joe’s account tonight to keep you updated on all things #DemDebate. Grab some ice cream and follow along! https://t.co/uXTJmM0dJH
I’m about to take the stage for tonight’s #DemDebate, so I’m passing the account over to my team. They’ll keep you in the loop throughout the night on everything happening. Follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates. Tune in to @MSNBC at 9 PM ET to watch live!
@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one.
@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again.
When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system.
This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be.
I give you my word as a Biden: I will never stoop to President Trump's level. https://t.co/1CAhAjKEju
I am deeply disturbed by the news coming out of my law school alma mater, Syracuse University. We are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/m6BNczblXY
On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear.
Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
I know we can beat Donald Trump in 2020—but we can’t do it without your help. We’re relying on grassroots donors like you to power this campaign and get our country back on track.

I’m inspired by the strength and resilience of Chrissy and survivors across the country, and proud of the change the Violence Against Women Act created, but we still have further to go.

China’s internment of nearly one million Uighur Muslims is among the worst abuses of human rights in the world today. The U.S. cannot be silent — we must speak out against this oppression and relentlessly defend human rights around the world. https://t.co/PQp04TWjyd
I’ve spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power. That’s what motivated me to write &amp; champion the Violence Against Women Act. The law helped change our culture—but there’s more work to do.

At the CNN Town Hall, I was asked what changes in American society I’m proudest of. Here’s what I had to say: https://t.co/X5OF6rwlJy
I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.
The American people deserve to know what the most corrupt president in modern history is hiding in his tax returns. https://t.co/QMMT8FEs3E
Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops.
The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve.
My favorite part of running for president is talking with people about their lives. So my team and I are going to pick someone to fly out to come meet me on the trail and share a meal, all expenses on us.

America is more equal because of Chief Justice Mark Cady.

.@realDonaldTrump, release your taxes or shut up about corruption. https://t.co/u3czWLj5ju
This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. We’ve always known that Donald Trump’s cruel immigration policies are a violation of our core American values. Now we know the architect of those policies has embraced and fanned the ugly flames of white nationalism. https://t.co/qmyRbxGdiq

If you like your private health insurance plan, you shouldn’t be forced to give it up. If you don't like it, you should be able to buy into a Medicare-like public option.

That's the choice I will give Americans as president. https://t.co/sHkmn3mDxP
Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.

Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer.
President Trump campaigned on repairing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. But after countless “Infrastructure Weeks,” he has failed to deliver results. It has to change.

Today, I'm calling for a transformational investment in our nation's future: https://t.co/mHG958ffo8
The Affordable Care Act
An assault weapons ban
The Violence Against Women Act

There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do. I know what it takes to get the job done.
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.

This decision puts the health of the American people at risk — it’s unacceptable. We must get Donald Trump out of the White House and choose science over fiction once again. https://t.co/YqVaGecPgQ
First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy.
We have to lead the world by our example and make clear that human rights, civil rights, and civil liberties matter to us. https://t.co/Ma26IxrInO

Change starts at the local level — I learned that firsthand as a 28-year-old on the New Castle County Council. On #NationalRunforOfficeDay, I'm asking you to join me and run for something. There is too much at stake in 2020 to sit on the sidelines. https://t.co/cEgKOoVhVI
President Trump's erratic, impulsive decisions threaten our national security and set our world on edge. Every day that he sits in the Oval Office is a dangerous day for the United States. https://t.co/QcUR5hVCdJ
Every worker should have the chance to join a union which bargains to ensure they get paid a living wage and have protections against sexual harassment. That's why I'm proud to stand with @McDonalds workers who are striking in Detroit and across the country today. https://t.co/r0y6uDM2na
Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist threats. It is intolerable that Israeli civilians live their lives under the constant fear of rocket attacks. That's why our administration was such a strong supporter of Israel's life-saving Iron Dome. https://t.co/aQOUdKZqq7

President Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans, and our sacred obligation as a nation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way, and care for them and their families. 

As president, I will meet our sacred obligation. https://t.co/TCUYaKtz8l
We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home.

Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them. https://t.co/jtOPJDnE30

Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare.
We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy.
Kids shouldn’t have to worry about their safety while they’re at school. Together — we’ll put an end to our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LvfaqNbpz7
This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country.
