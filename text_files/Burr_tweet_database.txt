My hope is that by continuing to shine a light on this issue, we will encourage more Americans to use social media responsibly, as discerning and informed consumers. 5/
Social media companies, federal agencies, law enforcement, and Congress must work together to address these challenges, and I am grateful for the cooperation our Committee has gotten from both the Intelligence Community and the tech industry. 4/
Any solution has to balance America’s national security interests with our constitutionally-protected right to free speech. 3/
By flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, Russia is trying to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans.
 
And other adversaries are following suit. 2/
Russia is waging an information warfare campaign against the U.S. that didn’t start and didn’t end with the 2016 election. Their goal is to sow societal discord and erode confidence in the machinery of government.

Since President Trump took office, the Senate has confirmed:

0⃣2⃣ Supreme Court Justices
4⃣3⃣ Appellate Court Judges 
9⃣9⃣ District Court Judges

That’s 144 strong, qualified judges confirmed to the federal bench to preserve the rule of law and uphold our Constitution.
#OnThisDay in 1914, #WWI began. It was called the "war to end all wars," but in many ways the first World War was the beginning, not the end, of the struggle for freedom and human rights that has shaped the last century.
Twenty-nine years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, improving the lives of millions. 
 
We’ve built on the #ADA with laws like the #ABLEAct, which is helping people with disabilities save for their future and reach their full potential.
3/ There has been great progress to improve our election security over the last three years, in part thanks to the Senate Intel Committee's efforts, and it's a testament to what we can accomplish when we give people the opportunity to be part of the solution.

After the IG’s devastating report, I led a bill to prohibit the IRS Commissioner from continuing this unacceptable practice. I'm happy to say it was signed into law as part of the #TaxpayerFirstAct, the most significant IRS reform in nearly two decades. 3/3

3/These indictments should send a clear message that the U.S. will not tolerate pernicious and illegitimate behavior that threatens our economic and national security.
2/Huawei is a global bad actor operating at the behest of the Chinese government and intelligence services. It seeks to undermine legitimate competition, while subverting laws and democratic institutions.
1/I am encouraged by @TheJusticeDept actions against Huawei, which detail the company’s brazen efforts to steal corporate trade secrets, commit fraud, and obstruct justice.
Reminder ➡️ Tomorrow @ 9:30am, Senate Intel will hear from @ODNIGov Dan Coats, @FBI Dir. Christopher Wray, @CIA Dir. Gina Haspel and others. Stream it live here: https://t.co/plW1fe44j6 #WorldwideThreats

With the 46th Annual March for Life this weekend, @SenThomTillis and I welcomed hundreds of North Carolinians to Washington. Great to see so many marching for such an important cause: the protection and sanctity of every human life. https://t.co/0qu2XIzJqb
The attack in Syria is a disturbing reminder that ISIS has not stopped its attacks on America and our allies. The servicemembers we lost today made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and my prayers are with their families.

It has been my great honor to work with Secretary Mattis on some of the most pressing national security challenges facing America. I thank him for his lifetime of service to our great nation, and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. https://t.co/j1qPoz3Xez
2/While @USTreasury has made great strides, this deal will require constant monitoring to ensure that neither Mr. Deripaska nor the Russian gov't violate the terms. Full statement here: https://t.co/bJdm7DBBai
1/Today’s @USTreasury announcement, which comes as a result of negotiated changes to the En+ corporate structure, does not change the fact that Mr. Deripaska and his companies work at Vladimir Putin’s behest &amp; operate as de facto representatives of the Russian government.
