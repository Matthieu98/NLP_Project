Great to welcome a fellow 4-H‚Äôer to the Senate! I look forward to working with @SenatorLoeffler who will be a strong leader for Georgia.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi The work has been done for Congress. The trade agreement has been written. All we have to do is say, ‚ÄúYes‚Äù for the American people.

Let‚Äôs get serious. Let‚Äôs do the simple task folks back home are asking us to do and pass the #USMCA.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi These hardworking folks know the impact the #USMCA will have on #Iowa‚Äôs economy, and the US economy as a whole. 

There is no reason Iowans should have to wait any longer. There‚Äôs no reason the American workers shouldn‚Äôt have the certainty they need.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi Whether at one of my 35 town hall meetings or during a farmer roundtable or visit to a small manufacturer, I heard consistently, and across the board, that Iowans want the #USMCAnow.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi I spent all year crisscrossing #Iowa to visit all 99 counties, as I do each year, and not once did I hear someone say we need to wait on the #USMCA. It was quite the opposite.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi The #USMCA is written. 

It's signed. 

It's agreed to by our partners. All we have to do is vote to pass it. 

It really is that simple, folks.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi Well, folks, there‚Äôs not much walking and chewing gum going on. Instead that gum seems stuck under a park bench while millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to trade wait for the Democrats to get serious.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi Let‚Äôs not forget though, when the House Democrats decided to go down this path, the American people were guaranteed that the House Democrats would be able to ‚Äúwalk and chew gum‚Äù at the same time.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi and her House colleagues have had more than enough time to pass the #USMCA, yet they‚Äôve failed to do so. 

Instead, House Democrats have been fixated on impeaching the President.
It‚Äôs been over a year since @realdonaldtrump signed the #USMCA. The ‚è∞ is ticking. I‚Äôm joining my @SenateGOP colleagues on the #Senate floor to push for passage of this important trade agreement. Tune in!

I hope lawmakers across the aisle will finally decide to put politics aside and actually work to support our military and ensure they‚Äôre getting the resources they need.
For the second time, Senate Democrats have blocked funding for our servicemembers, failing to give our troops their largest pay raise in a decade. Folks, we‚Äôve got to do better for our troops and their families.
We have an obligation as members of Congress to ensure our men and women in uniform are fully equipped to keep our nation safe. But instead of fulfilling that duty, Democrats are playing politics.

I met with Linda and Barb from @foodbankiowa to discuss ways we can combat hunger in Iowa, and across the country. https://t.co/wjX4TTirNv

al-Baghdadi‚Äôs demise makes this world a better place. I commend @POTUS, the intelligence community, and our special operations forces for this successful mission.

This serves as a warning to all terrorists: You cannot hide. We will bring you to justice. https://t.co/6l5HH6TxLz
Our tax dollars ‚Äì to the tune of $1.4 billion ‚Äì are being wasted on government agencies‚Äô mascots &amp; trinkets. This morning, I joined @VarneyCo to discuss my latest bill to stop wasteful spending by Washington bureaucrats. #MakeEmSqueal https://t.co/x6sSDrzn1Q
Taxpayers are being haunted by Washington‚Äôs spooky spending on pricey PR &amp; advertising campaigns, costing taxpayers in #Iowa &amp; across the country $1.4B+ each year. We need to pass my SWAG Act &amp; end this reckless spending. #MakeEmSqueal https://t.co/2OtO6NiCoS
As the national debt continues to rise, federal agencies are spending millions on coloring books, key chains, snuggies &amp; more. 

I‚Äôm giving my October Squeal Award to fed agencies for putting a premium on promoting their own public image.

$1.4 billion in taxpayer money is spent annually by government agencies on PR and advertising campaigns‚Äîtwice the amount dedicated to breast cancer research. It‚Äôs time to bag the swag. Today I introduced a bill to end this reckless spending. https://t.co/brOpjY9TZa
My staff will be available in 13 counties across the state today as part of our traveling office hours. Please feel free to stop by! https://t.co/kxcGKI8pWN
Washington bureaucrats need to be held accountable.

My CREEPS Act will help ensure federal employees convicted of sexual assault‚Äîwho are working on the taxpayer's dime‚Äîare held accountable and face necessary consequences. #MakeEmSqueal https://t.co/AGl8o6oCiZ
Our first responders work around the clock, day-in and day-out, to keep our communities in #Iowa and across the country safe. In honor of #NationalFirstRespondersDay, I want to recognize &amp; thank all of our first responders for their commitment to our communities! https://t.co/TW2L2TAXE5
#Iowans have been hit hard by disastrous flooding across the state. It‚Äôs imperative we rebuild damaged levees and look towards new solutions to improve flood protection in our communities. In an @EPWGOP hearing, I asked the Army Corps for an update on both efforts: https://t.co/h2EoXWNO9n

üö®A bipartisan bill I proudly support passed the Senate unanimously this week! We currently have a shortage of ag inspectors to protect our nation‚Äôs food supply, but w/our bill we‚Äôre changing that. This is good news for #Iowans, &amp; folks across the country.

Did you know the @FCC drastically overstated the broadband access in Chickasaw County? We need to fix that.  

My bill will go a long way in improving data, helping target resources to areas most in need, &amp; expanding access to broadband across Iowa. https://t.co/VtFSseL7oY
Drug take back programs are an important part of an all-of-the-above strategy for combatting the opioid crisis in Iowa. On #TakeBackDay, I encourage Iowans to participate and to visit https://t.co/FEq5V1mCno to find their nearest location. https://t.co/p8RYqvfEK9
#Iowa is leading the way in a number of areas, including our teacher leadership system. On the fed level, I‚Äôm working w/@ChrisCoons on a bill that will build off of @IAGovernor's efforts and help other states &amp; rural school districts around the country implement similar systems. https://t.co/eur85YDhPx
That‚Äôs why I worked hard to get my FARMERS FIRST Act included in the #FarmBill. Just this week, it was announced two #Iowa projects will be receiving resources to provide mental health support to Iowa‚Äôs agriculture community.
https://t.co/yXdPgEDwQh
#Iowa farmers work tirelessly from sunrise to sundown, in the rain and the shine, to feed and fuel the world. Their work isn‚Äôt easy, and mental health issues, including suicide, are becoming all too common in our agriculture community.

The sacrifice &amp; courage of the #GreatestGeneration is unparalleled, &amp; I‚Äôll continue to fight to ensure they get the recognition they deserve.

It‚Äôs imperative #Iowa farmers have access to mental health resources &amp; support. That‚Äôs why I worked hard to ensure my bipartisan bill to provide these resources was included in the #FarmBill, &amp; I‚Äôm thrilled to see Iowans benefit from this important work. 
https://t.co/yXdPgEV7HP
One year ago, @POTUS signed the #SUPPORTAct, bipartisan leg that included two of my bills to help combat the opioid epidemic in #Iowa, &amp; across the US. Thanks to @realdonaldtrump‚Äôs efforts, we‚Äôve seen:
‚úÖ more Americans receiving treatment
üìâ a decrease in drug overdose deaths
I met with folks from the @GreaterIowaCU earlier this week to discuss data security, regulation, and a number of issues important to them. Thanks again! https://t.co/N6O21VY0AV
Representatives from my office will be across the state today holding traveling office hours in the following counties: https://t.co/WEBYXa1R00
I was grateful to join @FLOTUS, @SecAzar, &amp; others for a roundtable discussion on the #SUPPORTAct, which included my bills to increase participation in Rx drug take back programs. Thanks to the admin for working w/Congress to help address this crisis‚Äìthere‚Äôs more work to be done. https://t.co/nUEtFpkrWQ
We can‚Äôt let this terrorist group gain any ground and our partners must step up and help ensure that ISIS never poses a threat to Americans and our allies ever again.
I believe it‚Äôs in our nation‚Äôs interest to develop a clear plan for this, which is something I‚Äôve called on the Department of Defense and the State Department to provide.
I‚Äôm encouraged by the announcement of a long term cease-fire between Turkey and the Kurds in Syria. But we need to make sure there‚Äôs a focused effort to ensure ISIS never reemerges.
There‚Äôs no reason #Iowans should be waiting in limbo for the #USMCA to be ratified. This trade agreement is a win for the American people, plain and simple. Let‚Äôs pass #USMCAnow. https://t.co/2VPS2HL9Ar
Lieutenant Governor Zimmerman was a trailblazer for many women in #iapolitics and was a dedicated public servant for the families &amp; communities of our state. My prayers are with her family during this time.

@SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats needs to do their job so that #Iowa farmers, manufacturers, and business owners can do theirs. 

Now is the time to pass the #USMCA.
@SenateGOP And it‚Äôs not just our farmers who will benefit from the #USMCA, it‚Äôs also our businesses and manufacturers. 

I was visiting with some business leaders at a roundtable in Des Moines and time and again they told me how important it is that we get this trade deal in place.
@SenateGOP I was up in Northwest Iowa a couple weeks ago visiting with one Iowa corn farmer and he said that if we were able to get the #USMCA deal done, it would have a direct positive impact on his farm.
@SenateGOP Passing the #USMCA will allow us to compete in the 21st-century economy. 

It will provide folks back home in Iowa with some certainty.
@SenateGOP This trade agreement is a win for the American people, plain and simple. 

Mexico has already ratified this deal, and Canada is well on their way. Our trade partners are ready.
@SenateGOP These hardworking folks know the impact the #USMCA will have on Iowa‚Äôs economy, and the US economy as a whole. 

There is no reason #Iowans should be waiting in limbo for this agreement to be ratified.
@SenateGOP From Humboldt County to Hamburg‚Äìat my town hall meetings or during a visit to a small business or manufacturing plant and everywhere in between‚ÄìI‚Äôve been hearing one thing consistently and across the board: Iowans want the #USMCAnow.
@SenateGOP So the question is, folks, what‚Äôs preventing Congress from getting the #USMCA done?
@SenateGOP Like continue on their partisan expedition toward impeaching the president. They passed a bill without a pay raise for our troops and spent a lot of ‚Äúenergy‚Äù on discussing a job killing ‚ÄúGreen New Deal.‚Äù
@SenateGOP It‚Äôs not because the House hasn‚Äôt had time. They have found time to do a lot of things.
@SenateGOP I come to the floor frustrated.  
 
Frustrated by the fact that it has been 327 days since President Trump signed the #USMCA and the House has done nothing to take it up.
SOON: A group of my @SenateGOP colleagues and I will be on the #Senate floor speaking on the need to pass the #USMCA. Tune in!

Fortunately, my bill, which would put a stop to these perks for future presidents, passed the House last week, putting it one step closer to being signed into law. 
https://t.co/7vpRfsvqnl
Former presidents rake in millions from speaking engagements, Netflix deals, &amp; other big money windfalls, but, believe it or not, taxpayers continue to foot the bills for the unlimited perks they still benefit from, like travel expenses and office space. That‚Äôs simply ridiculous.
They need some guidance on how best to do so. That‚Äôs why I asked Deputy Secretary of @USDA about the timeline for rolling out the National Hemp Program. https://t.co/h2CpGucgFF
Since we passed the #FarmBill‚Äîwhich included legislation I fought for to legalize industrial hemp‚ÄîI‚Äôve been hearing from many #Iowa farmers on my #99CountyTour about their interest in growing hemp to diversify their crops.
Starting this week, my staff will once again be hosting traveling office hours across all of #Iowa‚Äôs 99 counties. If you need assistance dealing with a federal agency, find a location near you:
