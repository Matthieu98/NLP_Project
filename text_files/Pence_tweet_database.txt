Tune in tonight as I join @JudgeJeanine to talk about how the @realDonaldTrump Administration‚Äôs winning agenda is working for all Americans! https://t.co/CNd7RtkAkU
Today we remember the tragic events that changed the course of history 78 years ago at Pearl Harbor and honor the memory of those we lost as they fought to defend our Nation and our freedom. 
https://t.co/iF6uUDci0U
Our Administration has not stopped fighting for the American people since day one and the numbers show that our policies are working in big ways! 266,000 jobs were added last month and the unemployment rate is at a strong 3.5%! üá∫üá∏
Wonderful stopping by a worship leaders briefing today at the @WhiteHouse! America is a proud Nation of believers and our Administration will always defend the freedom of religion of every American, of every faith! https://t.co/1IaeQ1gOZJ
Two years ago today, President @realDonaldTrump made history by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish State of Israel. Promises Made, Promises Kept! https://t.co/ps3RBkyhfj
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! They said it could never be done but this months expectation was demolished as 266K jobs were added‚Äî7 MILLION since Election Day‚Äîand the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more! https://t.co/x7rQiric80
Under President @realDonaldTrump the economy is booming, jobs are soaring, wages are rising and Americans are THRIVING! 

‚úÖ 7 MILLION jobs added since Election Day
‚úÖ 3.5% unemployment rate
‚úÖ A WIN for all Americans!
Saddened to hear of the horrible shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola &amp; continuing to monitor the situation. Praying for the victims &amp; their families &amp; we commend the first responders for their swift action in taking down the shooter &amp; getting those on base to safety.
It was an honor to speak at a remembrance event for @WhiteHouse families who lost a loved one to overdose. We are with you and we will keep working until the opioid epidemic is ended. https://t.co/6NZBc4kSHB
While Democrats continue their obsession with impeaching President @realDonaldTrump &amp; try to overturn the will of the American people, the #USMCA, drug pricing, military funding &amp; much more is falling to the wayside. Enough is enough, it's time for this charade to END.
Always an honor to visit with Americans Heroes, their families, and the incredible staff at @WRBethesda. Our Commander-in-Chief President @realDonaldTrump and our entire Nation are grateful your service and our prayers are with you! God Bless our Troops! https://t.co/1fKLy97qqJ
Great enthusiasm today at the @HouseGOP Conference meeting for our strong WINNING agenda! While the Democrats continue to waste the time of the American People on their impeachment sham, we will never stop fighting for what our Nation deserves! https://t.co/fwkXjNBHsb
Wheels up to Michigan! Great to see @RepHuizenga, @RepWalberg, and @RepFredUpton, who are doing great things for the people of Michigan, before we left DC! https://t.co/hUCmke1qnJ
What‚Äôs happening on Capitol Hill is a disgrace and the fact that it‚Äôs happening during a @NATO Conference in London is a disservice to the American people and the United States. https://t.co/0uOzRfbdpk
President @realDonaldTrump has been putting American workers first since day one and when the playing field is level, they can compete and win! https://t.co/QPq3njruIG

President @realDonaldTrump and I will never stop fighting for what the men and women of our Nation deserve! It‚Äôs time for Democrats in Congress to put the American people FIRST and get to work!
This month alone our Administration has honored those serving in the Military, traveled across the country fighting for the #USMCA, opened a major Apple manufacturing plant in the USA, announced 2 historic rules to make healthcare prices more transparent &amp; much more!
As the #USMCA collects dust on Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs desk and many other initiatives fall silent on the house floor, Democrats in Congress have proven once again that they care more about photo ops and political theater than working for the American people.
This week, President @realDonaldTrump is hard at work for our country at the #NATO70 Summit in London, while Speaker Pelosi and 14 Congressional Democrats are attending a climate conference in Madrid. https://t.co/P9EFRQVWGu
Today, @SecondLady and I stand with everyone living with HIV and AIDS and we honor the memory of those lost. #WorldAIDSDay
President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs deregulatory agenda unleashed American ingenuity and we are on path to becoming not just energy independent but energy dominant! Under this President, America is BACK! https://t.co/32zKNdiwEa
One year ago today, President @realDonaldTrump signed the #USMCA. While this Administration works FOR the American People, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress work AGAINST jobs for the American People. Our country needs the #USMCAnow! https://t.co/qTJ3D43BPv
.@SecondLady and I were humbled and honored to be at @MCASBeaufortSC today to serve a thanksgiving meal to our amazing men and women in uniform stationed there! We are so thankful to everyone serving in our Armed Forces! ü¶Éüá∫üá∏ https://t.co/8yPvNwA76W

America‚Äôs ‚Äúhero dog‚Äù Conan &amp; our incredible US Special Forces stopped by the @WhiteHouse! President @realDonaldTrump &amp; our Admin honor the courageous service of our Military &amp; recognize the vital role this service dog played in taking down Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. HEROES ALL! üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/3bplHHIr1Z

It was an honor to meet with President Barzani in Erbil on behalf of @realDonaldTrump today to reiterate the strong bonds forged in the fires of war between the United States and Kurdish people across this region. https://t.co/ctHNBIdxlD

.@SecondLady and I were so inspired being with our incredible military in Iraq! God bless our troops. Happy Thanksgiving! ü¶Éüá∫üá∏ https://t.co/lEQH5r0BGj
Happy Thanksgiving from Iraq. @SecondLady and I are so honored to be with our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines here in Iraq! We are so proud of you and thankful for you all! https://t.co/bzcM1fGgiG
This week Speaker Pelosi said we are running out of time to pass the #USMCA - well farmers, manufactuers, and hardworking Americans are running out of patience with the Do Nothing Democrats endless investigations.
Today‚Äôs Continuing Resolution proves that Democrats in Congress care more about their partisan impeachment inquiry than the American people. President @realDonaldTrump and I will never stop putting America FIRST because that is what the people of our Nation deserve. üá∫üá∏
Not only have they failed to pass a budget that includes critical funding for our National Defense and a pay raise for our men and women in uniform, the #USMCA has been sitting on Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs desk for over a year. Enough is enough, the American people deserve better!
Today, President @realDonaldTrump will be forced to sign a Continuing Resolution because Congress failed to do its job once again. They are spending more time trying to impeach the President than working for the American people that elected them.
Stopped by Indiana tonight to attend the Strada Education Network National Symposium, an organization that focuses on connecting today‚Äôs learners to the jobs of tomorrow. Our Admin will continue to work hard until every student is given the tools they need to succeed! https://t.co/eLU2dtUVK0
As Iranians take to the streets in protest, the Ayatollahs in Tehran continue to use violence and imprisonment to oppress their people. The United States‚Äô message is clear: the American people stand with the people of Iran.
President @realDonaldTrump made a promise to the people of this nation that we could be prosperous again and he delivered! Over the last three years businesses large and small have created more than 72,000 jobs in the Hoosier State and the unemployment rate is at 3.2%! https://t.co/El2D8UASOd
If you‚Äôre looking for a great cheeseburger in Wisconsin visit Mickey-Lu Bar-B-Q! Thank you for letting @RepGallagher and me stop by for lunch, we loved meeting everyone! https://t.co/0vn94y7KVK
Visited @FincantieriUS with @RepGallagher and @SecGeneScalia today where the handiwork and craftsmanship of so many men and women have been at sea for generations across America! https://t.co/l64PzGgzXt
The #USMCA is a trade deal that is good for Wisconsin and America! It will increase exports of milk and cheese in WI by 68,000. It is time for Speaker Pelosi to take the deal that has been sitting on her desk for over a year and pass it! #USMCAnow
Since President @realDonaldTrump was elected, 5,000 American manufacturing jobs have been created in Wisconsin and we‚Äôre just getting started! https://t.co/oM02T8MmWR
Fincantieri‚Äôs remarkable investment in Marinette started with a handful of workers &amp; a contract to build five wooden barges for the @USNavy during WWII. Since then, Marinette Marine has built more than 1,500 naval vessels, providing our Navy with some of the finest ships at sea! https://t.co/JnifOT2OLh
Today I toured @FincantieriUS, the largest employer in the region, who is investing $100 million in Wisconsin. Today the Do Nothing Democrats spent even more time on an endless investigation instead of the American people. https://t.co/8umRQq22mr
As we were en route to Fincantieri Marinette Marine we just had to pull over and visit the students and teachers of Garfield Elementary! So awesome meeting some amazing young Americans! https://t.co/exVpKsukOv
Thank you Wisconsin and @RepGallagher for the warm welcome! Happy to be back in the Badger State to visit Fincantieri Marinette Marine and show the people of America that our Administration is here for YOU! https://t.co/YsaITrMxom

Since President @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs election, 36,000 jobs have been created in WI &amp; this year, Fincantieri signed the Pledge to America‚Äôs Workers, pledging 3,000 learning &amp; training opportunities. See you soon WI! https://t.co/NnrPR1ZtE8
President @realDonaldTrump dedicated his entire @Cabinet meeting today to our nation‚Äôs veterans. From passing the most sweeping reforms of the VA in over 50 years to a 19-year low veteran unemployment rate, we will always fight to give the best of America, America‚Äôs best! üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/qAKG9IQEGw
Honored to meet with Native American Veterans today! Native Americans have bravely served our country in uniform and we are forever grateful for the contribution they have made to the life of our nation. Thank you for your service! https://t.co/kaEp0a8Cxi
It was a privilege to meet with former President Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa of Poland, a devoted champion for freedom and democracy. America will always admire his courage in turning Poland toward Democracy and helping to bring down the iron curtain. https://t.co/k9cki5oduy

The United States stands with President @jguaido and all Venezuelans in their fight for #libertad. Venezuela deserves a safe, democratic and prosperous future. With no legitimate claim to power, Maduro must go. The oppressed people of Venezuela deserve to thrive again!
Our Administration‚Äôs historic deregulation has rolled back the red tape that has burdened Americans and stifled economic growth. We look forward to continuing to protect Americans from overregulation through the Governors‚Äô Initiative!
Great launch of the Governors‚Äô Initiative on Regulatory Innovation this morning with @dougducey, @GovernorLittle, @GovStitt, and many governors from across the country. This initiative will help return power to the states.
We urge the Venezuelan military to stand with the people of Venezuela, not a despot. The Venezuelan military should be a force of good! The power to change for the better is in your hands!
Maduro and his gang of thugs continue to repress democracy. Yesterday‚Äôs raid on President @jguaido‚Äôs Party Headquarters is reprehensible and shows how weak and paranoid they are. Maduro has no respect for #libertad or the rule of law and he must go!
Congratulations to Chad Wolf on being sworn in as the newest Acting @DHSgov Secretary! Chad Wolf will be a great Acting Secretary as he works with President @realDonaldTrump to secure our borders and defend our homeland. https://t.co/5ersweISSk
Since the first day of our Administration, President @realDonaldTrump and I have never stopped putting America FIRST and we will continue to work and fight for each and every person of this great country! üá∫üá∏
Under the #USMCA, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise, on top of the raise they‚Äôve already received at record levels under President @realDonaldTrump. The #USMCA is a win for working Americans!
Today we welcome back to Norfolk the #USNSComfort, whose 5-month mission to Latin America &amp; the Caribbean helped those suffering at the hands of the humanitarian crisis brought on by the Maduro regime in Venezuela. https://t.co/XUQYEu1zaR
Another week has passed and the result:
- President @realDonaldTrump and our Administration working on the issues important to the American people
- Democrats in Congress desperately trying to overturn the will of the American people
The American people deserve the #USMCA:
‚úÖ $68 billion added to the American economy 
‚úÖ 176,000 jobs added for hardworking Americans
‚úÖ A fairer and freer trade deal for the 21st century 
 
#USMCAnow
This week, we join Sikhs around the world to celebrate the 550th anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first guru in Sikhism. Our Administration is grateful for the incredible contributions Sikh Americans have made &amp; continue to make to this great Nation!
