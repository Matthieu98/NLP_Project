If Republicans were willing to scrutinize billionaires *half* as much as they scrutinize people on food stamps, this country would be a much better place.
- Also, and very importantly, these jobs are for FREE. The public was going to pay $3 billion in public subsidies &amp; millions in hard cash building Amazon’s campus for them- NYC residents were subsidizing Amazon tons per job. Now they‘re bringing work without the welfare.
- “It’s in Manhattan, not Queens”: If you live in NYC, you would know people commute to work. Amazon would not have paid taxes for many, many years and not contribute to fixing our crumbling subway system. So lots of added strain, no benefit.
While we’re here, let’s clear up some GOP disinfo:
- “It’s 1500 jobs vs 25,000”: The 25,000 jobs figure was a 10-20 year fantasy # from Amazon, not a promise or agreement. In exchange for that lack of commitment, they wanted billions of public $. Their Y1 jobs projection was 700.
@monetxchange 💞💞💞
@peterjhasson You should know better. That 25k number was an unsubstantiated #, not a year 1 hiring figure. Nor was it a promise backed w/ consequences if it wasn’t met.

1,500 jobs off the bat is huge, &amp; a much better deal than paying billions for a fairy tale that would’ve displaced many.
Me waiting on the haters to apologize after we were proven right on Amazon and saved the public billions https://t.co/AC64pG0nZI https://t.co/xzCepkX4AV
Won’t you look at that: Amazon is coming to NYC anyway - *without* requiring the public to finance shady deals, helipad handouts for Jeff Bezos, &amp; corporate giveaways.

Maybe the Trump admin should focus more on cutting public assistance to billionaires instead of poor families. https://t.co/BbqhXbB9MM

@Heritage In other words:

A single mother of a 19 year old gets denied food.

A person who needs their car to drive to work gets denied food.

A disabled person whose paperwork is in limbo for months gets denied food.

Nice system you have there.
The devil (that starves low-income Americans) is in the details. https://t.co/lqxUqKjjCY
Or let’s talk about food stamps and cars!

This is one of the wildest rules to me.

If you have a busted car that’s worth a less than $5k (say, to drive to that work req), it can preclude you from food stamps.

See how these “rules” start to stack up?
https://t.co/yIc1YblMcR
If you have severe depression (or any number of mental issues), everyday life is very difficult. But it’s really hard to get disability status in general for mental health issues.

So if you need food stamps, and can’t afford a dr’s visit for a diagnosis/medicine, you go hungry.
These exclusionary “rules” sound great to anyone who hasn’t dealt with the actual lived experience. In truth it means paperwork, waiting, &amp; absurdist bureaucracy.

Let’s talk about the example of severe depression, which is an elevated risk for people in economic hardship.
The rule ignores the reality of American life.

Plenty of parents who support can’t claim “adult” (18+) children as dependents.

Getting disability status is notoriously difficult &amp;food is an immediate need. What if someone has an undiagnosed mental issue, like severe depression? https://t.co/UzBvF5dY7l
My family relied on food stamps (EBT) when my dad died at 48.

I was a student. If this happened then, we might’ve just starved.

Now, many people will.

It’s shameful how the GOP works overtime to create freebies for the rich while dissolving lifelines of those who need it most. https://t.co/WOrYvhfPj4
I was in that CBP facility. There were cameras and monitors everywhere. Are we really supposed to believe that every single camera and every single feed in the detention center happened to go offline the day that I and an entire Congressional delegation visited?

I don’t.
Of course CBP is saying the tape “doesn’t exist.”

Bc then everyone would see the horrifying conditions I was talking about.

If the full footage was released, you’d see CBP officers sneaking photos of me in secure spaces, and migrant women on the floor w/ their hair falling out. https://t.co/jewXpk8bAs

To our friends in the UK: please cherish, protect, &amp; continue investing in your healthcare system!

Once Big Pharma &amp; special interests get their hands on it, it could take generations to regain.

Millions of people in the US are fighting to have a system half as good as the NHS. https://t.co/gPR2oq7ZSw
A combined household income of $100k isn’t even “children of millionaires” territory.

That’s two parents making $50k/each. Does that sound rich to you? 

It’s not. It’s a working family. And just as tuition-free K-12 public school was an option, tuition-free K-16 should be too. https://t.co/LDjVOK3J2C
5. Lastly, and I can’t believe we have to remind people of this, but it’s GOOD to have classrooms (from pre-k through college!) to be socioeconomically integrated.

Having students from different incomes &amp; backgrounds in the same classroom is good for society &amp; economic mobility.
3. When you start carving people out &amp; adding asterisks to who can benefit from goods that should be available to all, cracks in the system develop.

4. Many children of the elite want to go to private, Ivyesque schools anyway, which aren’t covered by tuition-free public college!
1. Universal public systems are designed to benefit EVERYBODY! Everyone contributes &amp; everyone enjoys. We don’t ban the rich from public schools, firefighters, or libraries bc they are public goods.

2. Universal systems that benefit everyone are stronger bc everyone’s invested!
This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, &amp; it’s sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it.

Let’s talk about why Republicans are wrong on this.

Just like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition-free public college. 

Here’s why. https://t.co/pWprP0qrhG

Look out for those in politics who like to label themselves “fiscally responsible,” yet only seem to care about the price of justice - not the cost of oppression.

Everything has a price. And an unjust society is far costlier than one that invests in &amp; values all people.
None of the politicians who brand themselves “fiscally responsible” ever raise concern about rushing to shower ICE &amp; CBP w/ $billions with 0 guardrails or oversight.

None of them ask about how we pay for corrupt contracts or mass incarceration.

Ask yourself why that is.
This is honestly one of the big reasons why the argument about “pay-fors” in healthcare, housing, etc so often are made in bad faith.

I see decisions made every day that cost the American public billions of dollars a year for bogus reasons and nobody asks how we pay for it. /2
Earlier this year, Congress rushed to approve BILLIONS more $ for ICE + CBP.

I saw members voting YES w/o even a summary of the bill. Nobody cared then how we’d pay for it.

Now ICE is setting up fake universities to trap students.

Yet we were called radical for opposing it.
Abolish ICE. https://t.co/9uMtKmyEI1
None of this is a critique on lawmakers who dial for dollars - they don’t want to be doing it in the first place.

But to change this system, we must push hard to change the corrupting role of money in politics. And yes, those forces exist among all parties.
Our political system’s reliance on huge sums of money has many negative impacts, but one of the largest is that it takes lawmakers’ time away from lawmaking.

That’s a feature, not a flaw - the less time lawmakers have, the more special interests can slip in harmful provisions.
Instead, your support allows me to spend hours each day studying issues &amp; exposing abuse of power.

So while Fox continues to laugh that I’m “just a bartender,” I’ve spend the whole year studying big pharma, private equity, military contractors, and Mark Zuckerberg’s shady deals.
There is, of course, much more time for me to be fully present at my job. 

In Congress, this is a luxury. Since I don’t spend hours each day asking for money, I spend a lot more time legislating, studying, &amp; preparing/sitting in hearings.

This has cumulative effects over time.
I intentionally built my campaign to rely on small-dollar grassroots support w/o any corporate $, because I felt that’s the best way to be accountable to everyday people.

It has impacted how I work in Congress in powerful ways - ways I couldn’t fully appreciate until I got here.
While many try to belittle a progressive agenda that centers working people &amp; the public good, in truth it’s more powerful than ever.

I haven’t picked up a phone once this year to dial for dollars, &amp; I don’t meet w/ corp lobbyists. 

That is the power of your grassroots support. https://t.co/BDxvMETBnS
Public education, libraries, &amp; infrastructure policies (which we‘ve had before in America and elsewhere in the world!) are not “free stuff.”

People say that tech companies can’t fact check, but basic fact checking isn’t hard. We‘re talking abt blocking outright disinformation: wrong vote records, etc.
Many folks have asked whether I believe all social media political ads should be banned outright.

I believe that if a company cannot or does not wish to run basic fact-checking on paid political advertising, then they should not run paid political ads at all. /2
This is a good call. Technology - and social media especially - has a powerful responsibility in preserving the integrity of our elections.
