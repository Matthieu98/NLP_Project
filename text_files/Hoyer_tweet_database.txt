It is outrageous that China‚Äôs leadership announced retaliatory sanctions against US-based NGOs that are clearly not the source of protests.

Republicans continue to peddle conspiracy theories that Ukraine interfered in the 2018 election.
 
Our Intelligence Community has confirmed it was Russia that meddled in our election. Dr. Hill made clear that the only one who benefits from this conspiracy theory is Putin. https://t.co/aZKFT4bb24
Mr. Morrison was a witness requested by the GOP. He confirmed that the President conditioned a White House meeting and much-needed security assistance for Ukraine on an investigation into his political rival.

Like most witnesses, when Lt. Col. Vindman and Jennifer Williams were asked whether the President was directing a scheme on behalf of his own personal interests and not in the interest of national security, they both answered yes. https://t.co/JpaAAqP2Gw

David Holmes, a nonpartisan career foreign service officer, said in his testimony last week that it was obvious that the President was bribing Ukraine to investigate a political rival. The evidence is uncontested, and I urge my GOP colleagues to #DefendOurDemocracy. https://t.co/P1nqfsbEED

I thank Dr. Fiona Hill and David Holmes for their important testimony today, which shed light on the alarming scheme directed by the President to bribe Ukraine to investigate a political rival. House Dems will #DefendOurDemocracy
Dr. Fiona Hill and David Holmes are absolutely right. It would set a terrible precedent for Congress to allow a president of the United States to ask a foreign government to investigate a political rival.

The President‚Äôs actions cannot go ignored. https://t.co/uLCZ05FRGF
A domestic political errand.
 
That‚Äôs how Dr. Fiona Hill described Ambassador Sondland‚Äôs work, who was a key player in the President‚Äôs scheme to bribe a foreign government. That‚Äôs exactly what it was. https://t.co/ug7sTUpLMP
David Holmes provided a clear picture for the American people of POTUS‚Äôs pressure campaign on Ukraine, which was all about benefiting him politically and had nothing to do with addressing corruption. https://t.co/9NKVRIqDZp
In bribing Ukraine to interfere in our elections, the President has undermined national security and sown doubt that the U.S. stands firmly with Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. 

Who benefits from this scheme? 

Putin. https://t.co/asV0GANHVn
I commend Dr. Fiona Hill for setting the record straight like many previous witnesses have done. Russia ‚Äì not Ukraine ‚Äì interfered in the 2016 election. To suggest otherwise, as Republicans have, plays right into the hands of Putin. https://t.co/XWL1lE1rNL
The transcript of the President‚Äôs call with Zelensky had nothing to do with American interests, only his own political interests. https://t.co/tqyM1imEdd
Holmes just testified to the direct role Giuliani and an entire network of White House officials had in compromising our national security priorities and support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. This is damning. https://t.co/ylXAmSiTIY
The American people will also hear from David Holmes, a nonpartisan career foreign service officer and a firsthand witness to Ambassador‚Äôs Sondland‚Äôs call with President Trump about his scheme to bribe Ukraine.
Ambassador Sondland‚Äôs testimony shed light on the truth of the President‚Äôs actions:
- He directed a scheme to bribe Ukraine.
- There was a quid pro quo.
- Everyone knew. https://t.co/2KZPOYkK2a
This morning, Fiona Hill, an expert on Russian &amp; Eurasian affairs, will testify &amp; dispel the GOP‚Äôs false claims that Ukraine ‚Äì not Russia ‚Äì interfered in our election.

I thank @HouseIntel for their work today. It was a critical day in this impeachment inquiry and our efforts to pursue the truth for the American people and #DefendOurDemocracy.
Witnesses we heard from this evening also explained to the public why it matters that aid was withheld and what‚Äôs at stake: it‚Äôs important for the U.S. to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine and around the world.
The American people heard directly from Ambassador Sondland that POTUS directed a scheme to bribe Ukraine, there was a quid pro quo, and everyone knew. Then we learned Ukraine knew too ‚Äì as early as the 7/25 phone call.
David Hale ‚Äì a witness requested by Republicans ‚Äì agrees that withholding aid to investigate a political opponent is not a legitimate foreign policy objective. 

That‚Äôs bribery. That‚Äôs what the President did with Ukraine. https://t.co/25DdbK3b35
I join in thanking my good friend @GerryConnolly for his work on the Committee, and I know that he will continue to contribute positively and effectively to its mission.

The public is hearing from Laura Cooper, a DOD official who helped oversee the allocation of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, and David Hale, the 3rd-highest ranking official at the State Dept.

I thank @HouseJudiciary for marking up the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment &amp; Expungement Act today, an important bill to decriminalize marijuana &amp; reassess convictions. This bill will help communities of color disproportionately hurt by our current marijuana laws.
Ambassador Sondland‚Äôs testimony today was key in this impeachment inquiry:

The President directed a scheme to bribe Ukraine to investigate a political rival. 

There was a quid pro quo. 

Everyone knew. 

Do Republicans think that's okay?
Is it ever appropriate to invite, press, bribe, or coerce foreign interference in our elections? Ambassador Sondland, who was appointed by President Trump and was a key player in the President‚Äôs efforts to bribe Ukraine, agrees it is not. https://t.co/y6vbBtd7Yj
Should the President be allowed to ask for the investigation of a political rival? The answer from Ambassador Sondland ‚Äì as it should be from any American, regardless of party ‚Äì is no. https://t.co/6UxoVD9l1G
While the House has already passed legislation to condemn the Chinese government crackdown on protests in Hong Kong &amp; authorize sanctions, we will take up the Senate-passed bill today under suspension of the rules. Following passage, I urge @POTUS to enact this bill w/o delay.

Ambassador Sondland ‚Äì appointed by Trump himself and acting at the President‚Äôs behest ‚Äì confirms the President‚Äôs scheme was purely political, not about tackling corruption. https://t.co/TFg9s1TCtC
As we hear from Ambassador Sondland, who repeatedly delivered the President‚Äôs request to Ukraine for an investigation into a political rival, I ask once again: do Republicans think it's okay for POTUS to bribe a foreign government for his own personal gain? https://t.co/yazoWUiVzP
This morning, the American people will hear directly from Amb. Sondland, who will speak directly to how POTUS withheld security assistance &amp; a White House meeting to pressure a foreign government to investigate a political rival. No one, not even the President, is above the law. https://t.co/w1kI2V24pg
Every day, witnesses corroborate that the President and his allies conditioned military assistance for Ukraine on an investigation into one of his political rivals. Yesterday, we heard it directly from a witness requested by Republicans, Tim Morrison: https://t.co/qmG5W1uH1c
Rather than confront those facts, Republicans continue to perpetuate lies and attack the whistleblower and other witnesses. House Democrats will continue to seek the facts, and I thank @HouseIntel for their work to pursue the truth today.
Both witnesses today confirmed what we‚Äôve heard from multiple previous witnesses: the President and his allies conditioned military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into his political rival.
The public also heard from Tim Morrison ‚Äì who worked for Congressional Republicans for nearly 2 decades ‚Äì that Amb. Sondland told the Ukrainians that military funding was dependent on investigating the Bidens.
The Ambassador also confirmed that there is no basis for the debunked conspiracy theories about Joe Biden, which House Republicans continue to peddle.
Today, the American people heard from Ambassador Volker‚Äîwho was appointed by POTUS‚Äîadmit that he should have understood that POTUS &amp; his allies were requesting Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, something he considers ‚Äúunacceptable.‚Äù
.@RepValDemings highlights an important question here: Morrison says he saw nothing wrong with the call, but immediately reported the call to legal counsel. That doesn‚Äôt add up. https://t.co/m4oz8d7lB0
Volker is a witness requested by the GOP &amp; has corroborated key facts from multiple witnesses that POTUS &amp; his allies were asking the Ukrainians to investigate a political rival, something he considers ‚Äúunacceptable,‚Äù &amp; there was no basis for the debunked conspiracy theories. https://t.co/ShqTR1s6fU
I‚Äôm disappointed that the House was forced to pass another continuing resolution to fund the govt because of the Senate‚Äôs failure to complete their work.

I strongly condemn House Republicans‚Äô attacks on witnesses and the whistleblower today. These are patriots who are speaking the truth, and I thank Lt. Col. Vindman and Jennifer Williams for their courage to testify before the committee.
The witnesses described the President‚Äôs July 25 phone call as ‚Äúinappropriate and improper,‚Äù ‚Äúunusual,‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical in nature.‚Äù I commend them for being here today and sharing with the American people the facts of what they heard.
The testimony from Lt. Col. Vindman and Jennifer Williams ‚Äì two firsthand witnesses ‚Äì today show the American people a clear effort by the President to press Ukraine to announce investigations to benefit the President‚Äôs reelection campaign. #DefendOurDemocracy
This is the question before us as hearings continue this week: is it improper for POTUS to demand a foreign government investigate a political opponent? As @PeterWelch pointed out, we still haven't heard House Republicans answer that question. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/aVHClk2C8F
Witnesses continue to confirm this key point: it is not normal or acceptable for a President to ask a foreign government to interfere in our elections for his own personal gain. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/cinYmfwhd4
Finally, I said that during the December work period, House Dems will continue to get things done #ForThePeople, including considering the #LowerDrugCosts Now Act &amp; the #VRAA. I also urge @senatemajldr to act on legislation the House has already sent to the Senate.
I also said that the House will vote today to fund the government through 12/20. We must use this additional time to fully fund government before the end of the year. Time is not the issue; willingness to compromise is essential to get our work done.
Today at my weekly press conference, I told press that the American people are hearing from witnesses this week about how President Trump abused the power of his office and bribed a foreign government to investigate a political rival.
Republicans‚Äô continued attacks against the whistleblower and attempts to out him or her are shameful and ought to alarm every American. Every Member, regardless of party, ought to uphold whistleblower protections, which ensure honest government.
I agree with Lt. Col. Vindman, a decorated war veteran, that it is inappropriate for the President of the United States demand a foreign government to investigate his political opponent. https://t.co/Yt2mVEs70g
This morning, the American people will hear directly from witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the President‚Äôs call with Ukraine and how the President‚Äôs actions set off alarms across the White House. Tune in here: https://t.co/AzsMxeKvfO

Lt. Col. Vindman will testify today about what he heard on Trump‚Äôs call with Ukraine. He is a decorated war veteran and a patriot. I commend him for coming before @HouseIntel today to tell the American people the truth. #DefendOurDemocracy https://t.co/3rthIXDKXS

I thank @HouseIntel for holding another thorough, methodical hearing focused on the facts and uncovering the truth about the President‚Äôs abuse of power. I also applaud the service and courage of Ambassador Yovanovitch and thank her for testifying today.
While the President has a right to appoint and remove ambassadors, he is not entitled to removing a career diplomat who was doing her job and combating corruption because she stood in the way of his effort to bribe a foreign government into investigating a political rival.
Ambassador Yovanovitch's testimony shed important light on how the President's sustained pressure campaign to bribe Ukraine began: with the President removing a widely-respected, career diplomat with a record of anti-corruption work. https://t.co/L3WSMGaPG4
These attacks are shameful, dangerous, and must cease. We must protect this whistleblower and all future whistleblowers who might come forward. https://t.co/95YbYdRUVz

Today, the American people will hear from Marie Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who was respected for her work fighting corruption.

I urge all Members to vote for American workers and businesses and support the reauthorization of the @ExImBankUS today.
The @ExImBankUS reauthorization enjoys strong support from labor and the business community, including @USChamber, @MachinistsUnion, and @ShopFloorNAM.
Today‚Äôs bill will help ensure @ExImBankUS can continue to support job creation by: 
- Reauthorizing the agency for 10 years,
- Increasing the agency‚Äôs lending capacity,
- Ensuring the agency can continue to finance large projects even if the Senate fails to confirm Board members.
The @ExImBankUS is a good deal for American taxpayers. Over the past 10 years, the agency has generated more than $3.4 billion in deficit reduction.
In Fiscal Year 2018, 90% of @ExImBankUS authorizations directly supported small businesses, including 315 small businesses that used the agency for the first time.
Over the last ten years, @ExImBankUS has financed more than $255.2 billion in U.S. exports and supported 1.6 million U.S. jobs in all 50 states at no cost to American taxpayers.
The @ExImBankUS has been a major success story in countering aggressive foreign export credit agencies, including three in China alone, that finance exports from the global competitors of American businesses.
Today, the House will vote to reauthorize @ExImBankUS, which plays a critical role in helping businesses in the U.S. maintain a strong, competitive presence in the global economy. https://t.co/zChHLN0eyX
Students, families, &amp; residents of yet another community have been left traumatized by gun violence. This time in Santa Clarita.

The @ExImBankUS ensures American businesses can compete globally, increase exports, &amp; support jobs here at home ‚Äì at no cost to the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to give our exporters a fair, fighting chance by reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. https://t.co/l6F7QIJQRx

Today marks the 50 anniversary of the Apollo 12 launch, resulting in the second successful U.S. moon landing.

When POTUS &amp; his allies attack the whistleblower, they are putting that person‚Äôs safety at risk &amp; deterring future whistleblowers from coming forward. I urge POTUS &amp; all Members to cease &amp; desist from trying to intimidate this whistleblower &amp; those who might be whistleblowers. https://t.co/Y6EyzApW66

Did you know my office can help #MD05 residents w issues related to federal agencies? Tony Sampson was erroneously denied @SocialSecurity benefits, causing him to almost lose his housing. After my office intervened, his benefits were reinstated &amp; he was able to stay in his home.
This morning, I joined @MSNBC‚Äôs @Morning_Joe to discuss yesterday‚Äôs impeachment inquiry hearing, funding the government for the American people, and the despicable efforts by Republicans and the President to attack the whistleblower. Watch here: https://t.co/tyrJsfMvF6

Great to see @SmithsonianSec today and congratulate him on his role as 14th Secretary of the Smithsonian. I know he will demonstrate strong leadership as he oversees our nation‚Äôs most valued museums, libraries, research and education centers. https://t.co/iTWmgcR4zN
I enjoyed speaking to Prime Minister @miaamormottley today &amp; admire her historic leadership in Barbados as she leads the island in economic and structural reform. House Democrats will work alongside her in supporting the island and its people. https://t.co/ZjmYURg2Ub
Chad Wolf has a troubling record at DHS, including working to implement Trump's family separation policy. I am deeply disappointed by his confirmation to lead the agency and will work with my colleagues to hold him and the Admin accountable for pursuing an anti-immigrant agenda.
I applaud @HouseIntel for their methodical, thorough investigative work and for conducting today‚Äôs hearing with the seriousness and solemnity that it deserves. Despite the President‚Äôs obstruction, we will continue to pursue the facts for the American people.
If Republicans want firsthand witnesses to testify, President Trump and his allies in the Administration are welcome to come before the committee. But they aren‚Äôt. They are refusing to cooperate and obstructing this investigation. https://t.co/ElsNCMSobr
I agree with Ambassador Taylor ‚Äì withholding security assistance to a country fighting Russian aggression for no policy or substantive reason is wrong. RT if you agree. https://t.co/xBUAnLXYWW
It is dangerous and wrong for the GOP to target and intimidate the whistle blower. If House Republicans want to hear from the person that started it all, the President is welcome to come testify before the Committee, as @PeterWelch pointed out. https://t.co/8LfN7ZMnjp
I also told reporters that it is wrong and dangerous for the GOP to target the whistleblower, putting that person‚Äôs safety at risk and undermining future whistleblowers from coming forward.
At my weekly press conference today, I told reporters evidence continues to mount against President Trump and reveals that he abused the power of his office to bribe a foreign government for his own political gain. The President‚Äôs actions were wrong.
Yes, read the transcript. It‚Äôs all right there. From ‚ÄúI would like you to do us a favor though‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs very important that you do it,‚Äù it‚Äôs clear that the President abused his power to pressure Ukraine to interfere in our election. https://t.co/2mwbuC97zB
Republicans are wasting their time questioning witnesses on conspiracy theories, which have been debunked. Why? Because the damning testimony today has made clear the President attempted to bribe a foreign government to dig up dirt on a political opponent.
Before Republicans peddle conspiracy theories, before they try to distract from the issue at hand, here‚Äôs a career public servant setting the record straight. https://t.co/LYMbjklKuc
