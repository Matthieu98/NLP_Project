ICYMI, great news for Kingwood High School! This will allow @HumbleISD to make KHS more resilient to flooding.
 
KHS has experienced flooding for years. Our community is working to fix this. Weather shouldn't interrupt students' ability to learn &amp; grow.

*Admin tightens food stamps work requirements*

Dems: you‚Äôre starving people!

Reality: it‚Äôs a part-time work requirement applying to able-bodied adults with no kids. 

Dems want you to depend on govt. They think you can't move up &amp; succeed on your own.

https://t.co/UjiDFHhiwW
Since the day Trump was elected, Dems have questioned his legitimacy, undermined him &amp; called for his removal.

Now we know a vote on impeachment is imminent.

It‚Äôs partisan. It‚Äôs political. It‚Äôs Dems‚Äô #1 priority.

So no, Madam Speaker, you cannot dodge discussing it. https://t.co/ofxZKGf2vv

Government enforced price controls mean #fewercures are developed. The CBO is clear about this. 
 
When it comes to lowering drug prices, we CAN do it without stifling innovation. Here‚Äôs how: https://t.co/NDyok1tBmI
The world relies on our energy to advance human development and achievement.
 
We use the cleanest and most efficient processes to extract it. Exporting it leads to decreased emissions GLOBALLY. 
 
American innovation works.

https://t.co/ZZjSAvu7Wi
America is the innovation capital of the world. Hindering that capability will result in higher emissions. Keep that in mind next time you hear a politician‚Äôs environmental policy plan would eliminate some of the cleanest and most efficient energy sources in the world. https://t.co/zTMaGf2slq
The role of government is to tax its people as little as possible to cover the Constitutional duties of government, not make ever-increasing false promises to buy off voters. 

So how do we address our growing debt? 

Raising taxes? Or reining in spending? 

Watch the debate: https://t.co/5jySJzBjSV
Resounding message of self-governance and freedom. 

It‚Äôs almost like those principles are timeless and universal or something. https://t.co/JKlcDgKusP

The truth about Pelosi‚Äôs partisan drug pricing plan? It kneecaps innovation, which severely limits the ability of and incentive for American innovators to create new cures.

Hard to believe Democrat talking points that this impeachment inquiry ‚Äúisn‚Äôt political‚Äù when the charge they‚Äôre trying to make about the president changed because of focus group data from a campaign committee. https://t.co/znSvwh6gGC

In our public discourse, if you misspeak &amp; apologize, people should respect that.

Dowd didn‚Äôt do that. He traded one insult for another.

@EliseStefanik is highly respected. But because Dowd doesn‚Äôt agree with her politics, he had to insult her character.

Choice: 

A. pass #USMCA trade deal and get 176,000 jobs and $68B in GDP? 

B. focus on impeachment?

Dems: impeach! 

This impeachment obsession is not in the interest of the people. Pass #USMCA. Fed Chair Jerome Powell tells us why: https://t.co/YGkR8a8mkV
Despite claims to the contrary, the policies under Republican government have resulted in much higher wage growth for the lowest-income earners. https://t.co/EKaSafMgB5

The Green New Deal isn‚Äôt just unaffordable, it‚Äôs also technologically infeasible.

Everything Dems have done is just an effort to build a narrative against Trump. Facts aren‚Äôt on their side, which is why they‚Äôve kept everything behind closed doors, selectively leaking when it suits them.

This vote doesn‚Äôt change the facts. It just codifies their process. https://t.co/dCjVqTdy3M
Baghdadi is dead thanks to decisive action by POTUS and our Special Operators. Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves: our small, cost-effective presence allowed this moment to happen.

Recognizing this tragic period in history is long overdue.
 
I‚Äôm proud to cosponsor this resolution, which commemorates the many innocent lives lost and destroyed in the #ArmenianGenocide and acknowledges the historic reality of this horrible event. https://t.co/4t2r1G9D4m
This is what is possible with a forward deployed presence and strong, intelligence-sharing relationships. Now we must keep pressure on the mid-level ISIS leadership that will seek to replace him. Congratulations to JSOC, the intelligence community, and the President.
Today is a good day in America. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead and our enemy is significantly weaker. I‚Äôm proud of our U.S. Special Operators who carried out this high-risk mission and applaud the administration for its decisive action.

Adam Schiff isn't allowing Reps. to see the transcripts from this impeachment inquiry, but selectively leaks small portions to the press. This process should be transparent to the American people.

Today‚Äôs discussions were not easy topics, but they are crucial to making our community safer. Houston is one of the worst cities for human trafficking. We change that by empowering people with the knowledge needed to identify and prevent it. Together we can make a difference.
Next up were representatives from various nonprofits &amp; organizations like @DeliverFund, @YMCAHouston, @DHSBlueCampaign and Family Time as well as a member of @GovAbbott‚Äôs child sex trafficking team. On this panel, we discussed how people can help the victims of human trafficking. https://t.co/2xtgSXpqO1
The first panel included representatives from @houstonpolice, @HCSOTexas, @TexasABC, @FBI, @FLETC and @ICEgov. We discussed how to recognize and address human trafficking from a law enforcement perspective.
 
Grateful to have experts like these protecting our community. https://t.co/4Z7CpCgkhT

Leaving the region and allowing a Turkish incursion could have devastating consequences for our Kurdish allies who have been instrumental in fighting ISIS by our side. Based on what we know now, this move provides no benefit to American national security.
It‚Äôs difficult to say the exact impact of a policy that has yet to be defined, but troop withdrawal or decrease in Syria is very concerning. Our small, but effective presence there is key to stabilizing the region and maintaining pressure against ISIS.
According to the ‚ÄúGreen New Dealers,‚Äù nuclear is dangerous and hurts the environment.

Whether it is appropriate for the President to discuss that on this particular call is simply a political question. But it is a question of style, not legality.
To answer the first part: it is legal for the United States to work with foreign governments on investigations, especially an investigation involving American influence.
The issues being raised are twofold: is it legal for President Trump to ask about allegations regarding a political opponent, and is it appropriate?
I‚Äôve read and analyzed the transcript of the Zelensky call and the whistleblower complaint, which is based on testimony and news reporting without any first-hand knowledge. Neither document seems to provide evidence of quid pro quo or election interference.
It‚Äôs the result of a political party blinded by their dream of taking down the President.
 
We don‚Äôt impeach someone based on conjecture and hypotheticals. We don't assume the worst case scenario before hearing the facts. Let‚Äôs talk after the transcripts are released.
The Democrats‚Äô true intentions have always been impeaching the President. It‚Äôs been a core piece of their agenda since 2016 and today they were finally honest about it.
 
Opening an impeachment inquiry without having all the information is irresponsible.
Thrilled to see what the young leaders at @ACC_National are doing to address climate change in a smart, conservative way.

Trade is crucial to Houston‚Äôs thriving economy. Enough with the political games. We need to pass #USMCA.
Thanks to POTUS &amp; his executive actions, we‚Äôre seeing a decline in border apprehensions.

It‚Äôs good news, but is no excuse for Congress to continue ignoring its responsibilities. Our system is flawed &amp; only Congressional action will permanently change it.

Care for a wager? 

Winner gets to display their team‚Äôs flag in other member‚Äôs office. 

Hope you have space cleared...
Spot on. Blaming climate change for the existence of hurricanes is deliberately misleading, AND not even supported by the science.

It also distracts from the real solutions to prep for hurricanes: updated infrastructure &amp; building codes, and smarter management of coastal living. https://t.co/BVRo2LSGzF

Human trafficking is a heinous crime. Grateful for law enforcement and their efforts to eradicate it. Awesome job to @HCSOTexas for executing ‚ÄúOperation: Independence‚Äù and arresting perpetrators of this horrible crime right here in Houston.

Hey, here are some bipartisan solutions that clean up the environment, promote innovation, don‚Äôt ruin the economy, AND are based in reality!

Or we can believe in fairy tales and socialist utopias by banning nuclear, cleaner natural gas, plastic straws and cows. #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/Poaz77SHwV
Another ill conceived plan that priortizes handicapping our economy rather than reducing global emissions.

I‚Äôm sure CNN‚Äôs climate town hall tomorrow will be based on facts &amp; good ideas, not fear mongering &amp; socialism in the form of ‚Äúenvironmental policy.‚Äù

Americans always come to each others‚Äô aid in disasters. We must also look to help our neighbors in the Bahamas who have been absolutely devastated. https://t.co/wKbaTu9x2e
Praying for the victims and their loved ones in Odessa and Midland. Thank you to the law enforcement officers who acted swiftly to keep their communities safe. We are better than this senseless violence. https://t.co/JxHKNxNmku
The most basic responsibility I have is hearing from constituents, whether they agree with me or not. As their representative, it is my duty to hear them out and have an honest dialogue.

Thanks to all who braved the weather and attended our town hall. https://t.co/v7xDrfbIom
When WWII ended, debt to GDP ratio was 114%. 

Why is it approaching that number today, when we aren‚Äôt fighting a global war? Because we refuse to address runaway spending on entitlement programs. https://t.co/ys7LkQZSLt
This is exactly right. This policy has single-handedly incentivized mass illegal immigration &amp; endangered thousands of children along the way. Good intentions don‚Äôt always have good results, and this particular well-intentioned policy has been disastrous. https://t.co/M9XFYxXMjt
Today is #NationalDogDay. Celebrate your pups. https://t.co/MwGNdf3U4M
HUD finally released the over $4 billion in federal flood mitigation funding. My statement on it: https://t.co/qtFCo28Jwl
100% renewables in 11 years? 20 million jobs? Must be nice to make things up and pass it off as serious policy.

We‚Äôre at 15% renewables now, only bc of massive govt subsidies.

There is a place for renewables in an #AllofTheAbove approach, but Bernie‚Äôs plan is pure fantasy. https://t.co/dKjlnWLbsg
Happy Friday y‚Äôall. https://t.co/CCOQ12uuwe
Sure, that‚Äôs why so many oil and gas companies are investing in carbon capture technology so we can vastly reduce global emissions.

Or just keep creating a boogeyman so your supporters stay properly outraged. Great politics. üëç https://t.co/N0FUREwNX0
Same. https://t.co/hDFJfYn7s0
I agree with @RepEliotEngel &amp; @RepMcCaul, this will ‚Äúdeter China as they threaten our strategic partner Taiwan and its democratic system.‚Äù

It‚Äôs especially true given what we‚Äôre seeing in Hong Kong as China amasses paramilitaries along its border.

Yesterday I spent my morning at @karbachbrewing to brew my own beer for @AnheuserBusch‚Äôs Brew Across America challenge. 

We‚Äôll be competing against other member-made beers this fall. Only thing left to do: name it. What do you think?
Thanks @USACEGalveston, @HCFCD, @FEMAregion6 and @TexasGuard for the tour and update on Harvey related projects and flood mitigation projects. We still have work to do, but we‚Äôve made good progress. https://t.co/9QpOJNHWRz
Hard to believe the righteous indignation when you support the economic destruction of a country, then get mad when they don‚Äôt let you in.

These Congresswomen proudly back the anti-Israel BDS movement. Israel has a consistent policy of denying entry to those who do. Nothing new. https://t.co/Z9kjSXxo5R
I recently joined HPD during an active counter human trafficking operation in Houston. Awesome to see @HCSOTexas and @HoustonPolice working hard every day to combat this atrocity and help the women it victimizes. https://t.co/Mk4ZgBrA1u
First Maduro ran Venezuela‚Äôs economy into the ground, leaving his people hungry &amp; hopeless. Now he‚Äôs torturing members of his own military. 

This is what a desperate, disgusting dictator does to stay in power. This is why we support a free Venezuela. https://t.co/zmHXped5bz
We all know that we need to save Social Security both for our current seniors and for future generations. When we talk about solutions, we first have to understand the problem. Here are the common myths about Social Security.

America is proof that democracy is worth fighting for. Protesters in Hong Kong are fighting for that same reason. Even in the face of China‚Äôs aggression &amp; police brutality, they're standing by their worthy cause. We hear their demands for freedom &amp; support them in their mission. https://t.co/N4vkPkfvJA
Negotiations are good. Peace talks are good. They should continue. But I currently see no circumstances where a total US withdrawal or a political timeline can be justified. Let‚Äôs keep that in mind as we consider the next steps.
Before we reactively cry ‚Äúno more endless wars‚Äù we must consider what that means in practice. It means we give them the space and time to plan another 9/11.

My former teammates have no problem ensuring this doesn‚Äôt happen. We should let them do their job. https://t.co/xHc43XzmrX
It‚Äôs clear that there has been some confusion about what conservatives would support when it comes to laws that try to better protect our communities. Let‚Äôs address this directly. Watch. https://t.co/TRYjPIclEm
Not surprised. 

But implementing dem policies that cost hundreds of billions of dollars would only hurt my generation even more. 

We want a strong economy so we can build our future like our parents did. Pro-growth policies are the way we get there.

If you missed the past 7 months - and the debates on border security, healthcare, the debt, flooding, and more - then don‚Äôt worry. We have the highlights right here. 
 
Proud to serve and keep serving.

Today is #PurpleHeartDay. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for my fellow service members and Purple Heart recipients, especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We are forever indebted. Our world is safer because of them. #NeverForget
White supremacy has no place in this world. Violence inflicted because of someone‚Äôs race or ethnicity is vile, repulsive, and one of the worst evils we face. It must end.
The solutions aren‚Äôt obvious, even if we pretend they are. But we must try. Let‚Äôs start with the TAPS Act. Maybe also implement state ‚Äúred flag‚Äù laws, or gun violence restraining orders. Stop them before they can hurt someone.

These disgusting mass shootings have been following a pattern ever since Columbine. Sick and lonely men have decided this is how they will vent their frustration.
In disbelief at another tragic shooting. Tara and I are praying for the victims and their families. Thank you to the Dayton police who took out the coward who did this in one minute. Houston stands with El Paso and Dayton as their communities heal from these senseless tragedies.
This is great news. Dam gates will dramatically improve the city‚Äôs ability to manage Lake Houston‚Äôs water and accommodate heavy rainfall. Better management means less flooding. Grateful to partner with @CMDaveMartin, @chiefkidd and @SenCreighton to get this done. https://t.co/a2n02RfrUK
