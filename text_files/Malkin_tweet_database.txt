@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Good point:
https://t.co/GnSatRoZ2o@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Meanwhile, in related news: "Chickenpox vaccine reactivates in two boys, causing rare meningitis more commonly seen in unvaccinated kids." But NEVER question vaccine safety and efficacy cuz that's "conspiracy theory!"

https://t.co/cKk4oTH0nJ@JonathanFalcons @RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Same thing happened to us in 2004 when we questioned timing of Hep B shot for my newborn son ==&gt;
https://t.co/LZnmDCwzIB@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Staunch, informed pro-life conservatives have long challenged the use of aborted fetal cell lines to manufacture vaccines ==&gt;
https://t.co/VylQtLFv7t
chart via @AmerLifeLeague https://t.co/7zaBf51EOf@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO This proves my thread's point &amp; underscores pathetic state of "conservative media," now dominated by snotty toddlers who couldn't bother trying to comprehend meta-analyses, case control &amp; cohort studies, let alone VAERS data. Because feelings &gt; facts.
https://t.co/Ec9C02K0wn@AmerLifeLeague @RobSchneider @dcexaminer Exactly. Advocates of mandatory jab schemes have gone out of their way to cover up use of aborted fetal cells in vaccine manufacturing.
https://t.co/V83OwqjMH1@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Protecting national sovereignty begins with protecting family sovereignty--and the freedom to speak in defense of both!@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch @WHO Informed parents who follow the money &amp; expose truth about #BigPharma 's vaccine racket are defamed &amp; deplatformed by same #BigTech #BigGovernment forces on Left AND Right who target critics of sharia, Antifa &amp; open borders. It's all of a piece. See?

https://t.co/usqwAaM2q6@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch Many "conservative" outlets praised @robschneider for exposing Big Tech's war on free speech, but whitewashed his vital message about defending *freedom to question vaccines.* My March 2019 on @WHO /Silicon Valley's war on vaccine skeptics here:
https://t.co/YEYPvGbX3S
/11@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT French oncologist Gerard Delepine reported that while other Euro countries w/high HPV uptake have reported increased cervical cancer rates, France (low 15% uptake) saw steady declines between 1995-2017. https://t.co/T3cwExeIpH
/10@RobSchneider @dcexaminer @JudicialWatch FACT A 2015 study published in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics reported that HPV vaccines failed to protect young women from certain high-risk HPV types and that more study was needed ‚Äúto determine its effectiveness in a real-world setting.‚Äù 
https://t.co/GWDlW9pZKo
/9@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT @JudicialWatch reported in 2013 that National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had paid out nearly $6 million in claims to 49 victims of HPV vaccine, including two deaths.
https://t.co/1QTDC2O4XO
/8@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT A 21-yr-old woman died of heart arrhythmia induced by autoimmune response to HPV vaccine; her family sued US HHS in federal court (pvt drug makers are shielded from liability) &amp; received compensation for daughter‚Äôs vaccine-caused death in 2017.
https://t.co/JNYfR4Znzj
/7@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Denmark reported multiple cases of girls developing autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome after receiving HPV shots. 
https://t.co/YIA61USTk8
/7@RobSchneider @dcexaminer FACT Japan suspended its HPV vaccination program aimed at teen girls after researchers reported adverse symptoms from chronic pain and motor impairment following immunization. 
https://t.co/isXB0xJ2zN
/6@RobSchneider @dcexaminer Gardasil/HPV vaccine isn't about "safety" or "public health." It's about $$$. HPV global market = $5-7 BILLION in sales for Merck by 2025 as an STD shot was transformed by marketing gurus into a cervical cancer shield for both female and male ages 9-45.
https://t.co/E5nsrCObfd
/5@RobSchneider @dcexaminer It's not just Dems who've sold out kids. Repubs are on the take, too. I reported on former Tx Gov. Rick Perry's  appalling Gardasil mandate extensively a decade ago (repealed after grass-roots uproar). Merck poured $400k into RGA, Perry's biggest donor.
https://t.co/GPh8lBf0Ke
/4@RobSchneider @dcexaminer NY is preparing to pass draconian HPV mandate requiring jab for all girls &amp; boys born after 2008 *without parental consent.* Every limited-govt conservative should be up in arms! Dem sponsor spouts"safe &amp; effective" talking points; his spouse is Merck stockholder. 
/3@RobSchneider Last week, an ignorant snot from the "conservative" @dcexaminer attacked my work challenging HPV/ Gardasil mandates &amp; pro-vaccine orthodoxy from pharma lobbyists &amp; their shills in politics. Pure ad hominem. No facts: /2 https://t.co/kusDhRi4bCTHREAD: My new column this week is about the freedom to question vaccines, which is under escalating assault by Big Pharma, Big Government &amp; Big Tech.

It's all about control.

#GatekeepersExposed https://t.co/EOULND5rGWHere is what free speech defenders at https://t.co/sAjUOcX2c0 say about the laws in question:

https://t.co/QJxtwMMODVYou failed to answer serious questions by patriotic students about free speech, identity politics &amp; demographics. Your response then &amp; now is to smear those who put #AmericaFirst &amp; actually MEAN it.

Conservatives need to know the difference.

#GatekeepersExposed #OpenBordersInc https://t.co/MG3bW0GiMZFYI, the Left &amp; ConInc both framed YAf's blacklisting of me as a "firing." 

I did not work for YAF. I am not employed or owned by any of the Keepers of the Gate. That's why their attempt to un-mainstream me has been so coordinated &amp; vicious. 

It's all about control. https://t.co/PUyGcqnJqwI‚Äôm still here, Junior Gatekeeper snot. What are you going to do? Coordinate with SPLC and Silicon Valley? This isn‚Äôt about Fuentes. It‚Äôs all about control. https://t.co/C3ORqOqTVS@AsamomMA @TheKuhnerReport @JessicaV_CIS It is ON!!! See you there!This snot-nosed lemming from the "conservative" Washington Examiner recycles brazen lies &amp; smears from SPLC/HuffPo/Soros and his editors call it "journalism." It's clickbait virtue signaling for Beltway donor class. This is what's become of Con Inc media:

#AmericaFirst https://t.co/jsnLxCa0GAA lot of young people have suffered and risked a lot more than me in this battle. I will not abandon or forget them. https://t.co/cqbCfb9Dm8I agree. Shame on cancel culture cowards who cave to the censorious Left. And Right. https://t.co/43YAgU8HMSThank you, Amy, you‚Äôve been at the forefront combating the forces of evil, hatred, and censorship - grateful for all you do! Never back down. https://t.co/zTNdI1T7pCMass migration demographics doom American sovereignty. That was message of UCLA speech that got me blacklisted by @yaf - it‚Äôs message of #OpenBordersInc &amp; my CPAC speech. And it‚Äôs the message of kids being smeared on campuses. Establishment GOP‚Äôs solution? Shoot the messengers. https://t.co/5YEawo7dgL@LibertarianBlue Thanks, Allum!@jeremycarl4 Thank you, Jeremy!@johnhawkinsrwn Thanks John!@johnfulks99 @bridgeinit Never.So Georgetown has its own version of the SPLC smear machine called @bridgeinit . Thanks for the free advertising, fear-mongers! I'm sure your "research" will be regurgitated on Con Inc/ #openbordersinc Twitter accounts any minute now. https://t.co/NtY5Dlb8bIThank you @bboinc14 - #BackTheBlue #StandWithICE ! https://t.co/1TeSo8xtg1Families like mine, which revere rule of law, common traditions, constitutional principles, 1 identity &amp; 1 tongue, have been replaced by militantly unassimilable &amp; hostile generations of future Democrat voters whose tribal allegiance to the Left has only hardened over time. https://t.co/aBHO5BLlO0
